Welcome
=======
FluffOS is an LPMUD driver, based on the last release of MudOS (v22.2b14), includes 10+ years of bug
 fixes and performance enhancement, with active support.

FluffOS supports all LPC based mud with very little code changes. if you are currently still using MudOS somehow
 it is definitely time to upgrade!

Version
--------
The current release is v2019. With cmake based build system, it supports running on Linux/OSX/Windows(both WSL & msys2).

V2019 features includes:
- Built in websocket support.
- full UTF-8 aware LPC string & EFUNs, with transparent user input/output transcoding.
- SHA512 crypt by default.
- LPC Tracing

V2019 Platform Targets:
- Linux Ubuntu 18.04
- MacOS OSX 10.15
- MSYS2/mingw64 on Windows 7+

The previous release is v2017. With an autoconf based build system, it supports compiling on centOS/ubuntu and under
 windows using CYGWIN. This release is no longer supported, it is kept only for historical interest now.

All previous MudOS and FluffOS releases are also kept in the code base as tags for historical reference.
