Welcome
=======
FluffOS is an LPMUD driver, based on the last release of MudOS (v22.2b14), includes 10+ years of bug
 fixes and performance enhancement, with active support.

FluffOS supports all LPC based mud with very little code changes. if you are currently still using MudOS somehow
 it is definitely time to upgrade!

It is recommended to use the latest release on Github or the master branch, previous versions (v2017 in particular) are
not supported.

Build
-----
FluffOS's main platform is ubuntu 22.04 LTS, but also works on latest OSX and Windows (MSYS2/mingw64), WSL with
ubuntu 22.04 works fine too.

Build system: cmake (3.20)

Features
--------
LPC Language since FluffOS v2017
  - LPC string operations are UTF-8 EGS aware, range operator supports emoji and other unicode characters.
  - various new EFUNS for transparent input/output transcoding.

LPC Language since MudOS
  - Please read docs/archive/ChangeLog.* files for details

Driver Runtime
  - Jemalloc support
  - SHA512 crypt by default.
  - LPC Tracing
  - Mysql, Postgresql, SQLLite integration
  - Async IO operations
  - External program integration

Networking
  - TLS support
  - Websocket protocol support (with a minimal example for a webclient)

LPC Standard Library
  - see files under testsuite/std.

Misc
  - Testsuite for all EFUNS
  - Detailed memory accounting (through mud_status(1) EFUN)
  - Memory leak detection

V2017
-----
v2017 is the legacy version, with an autoconf based build system, it supports compiling on centOS/ubuntu
and under windows using CYGWIN. This release is no longer supported, it is kept only for historical interest now.

All previous MudOS and FluffOS releases are also kept in the code base as tags for historical reference.
