In order to add a package, do the following:

(1) Pick a name for your package (we will use 'foo' here)

(2) Create a directory, put the efun defination in foo/foo.spec.  If your code needs to export
    addtional symbols for the rest driver code, create a foo/foo.h for automatic inclusion.

(4) add #define PACKAGE_FOO to local_options.

(3) implement the efuns in "foo.cc", you can have multiple file if needed. During make,
    tools/build_package_makefile.py will create a package_foo rule with all ".cc" files

(4) If your files needs custom compile flag, create a Makefile.foo and add

package/foo.o:
  $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) package/foo.cc

(5) do a full recompile (make clean && make)
