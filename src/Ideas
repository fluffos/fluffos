The general solution to error handling is actually quite simple.  I have
thought about adding it, but never got around to it.

  1. A new sub-type of int would be created called ERROR.
  2. A new predicate function would exist called errorp().
  3. All efuns would return an int/error svalue when an error is
     detected during efun processing.
  4. A new mudlib-imported error.h file would exist to define error
     numbers in terms of #defines (the #defines would be used in both
     the driver and mudlib code)
  5. A function (call it perror()) would exist that accepted an error
     wvalue and returned a printable string.
  6. All efuns would be converted to use these new error svalues and
     associated numbers.

All mudlib code that did things that could error out would either:

  data = efun(..);
  if (!data-type-expectedp(data))
    return;

or:

  data = efun(..);
  if (errorp(data))
    return;

return would be replaced with whatever error recovery action would need to
take place in that context.  Errors could then be trated in an integrated
fashion throughout the driver/mudlib.

Comment:
    Don't forget the perror() efun mentioned in the man page.

### I'm not sure this is the best way to go.  -Beek

we need to made a single-user option for MudOS that doesn't use sockets
at all so that people wanting to run MudOS at schools where programs
aren't allowed to listen on socket (anti-mud policies) can use MudOS
for developing LPC code for another mud.

It'd be cool if there were efuns like this:

mapping x;

attach_mapping(mapping x, string filename);

detach_mapping(x);

which would attach mapping x to the database named by filename.

any accesses to the mapping x would in fact manipulate the database.

This would work much the way attached mappings work in Perl.

We could use the dbm database code in UNIX(tm).  Only problem is
not all UNIX's have dbm's that support multiple databases per
UNIX process.

I agree; it does seem that we need a variant of call_out that operates in terms
of number of heartbeats rather than absolute # of seconds.  A few ways
to do this.

// optionally change the way call_out() works so that muds can change it if
// they like.
#define CALL_OUT_UNITS_EQUAL_HEARTBEAT /* or some shorter similar thing */

Or we could make a call_out2() efun that operates in the desired heartbeat units
(name it something more appropriate than call_out2()).

1) Have the z command in the editor check the user's PAGER settings.
   ie: getenv("LINES")  much like the mudlib's more command does.  If there
   isn't any setting, you can have it default back to the standard z length.

hmm, save_object() should probably somehow save the subtype of numbers.
(ie null, undefined, error, etc)

Comment: with some of the optimizations lately, the subtype of numbers is
	not always reliable longterm ...

An option for persistent swap files (that the driver can restore/recover
from), saving clones and the contents of variables.

### This seems to be a fad and a bad idea, but I'll get flamed for saying
	 that ...

mudlib_stats uses a linked list, it is fast for insertion; however
  lookup is O(n)...this should be hacked to use an AVL tree (ala uid.c)

#pragma no_inherit
#pragma no_clone

-- Cygnus & Descartes

Comment:
    Unlike regular C, should these two pragmas should generate warnings
    (or error out) if the driver wasn't compiled with this option enabled?

    Also, adapt Tensor's idea for uniquep() efun...which queries these
    flags, telling whether an object is cloneable and/or inheritable
    (or not, depending on your point of view).

    These aren't object flags as first believed...they have to be stored
    in the program structure, so that it can be restored from binaries.
    pragma_no_inherit & pragma_no_clone flags should probably be in
    simulate.c, disjoint from those in lex.c.
        clone_object()
          ob = find_object_no_load()
          if (ob->prog->flags & P_NO_CLONE)
            error("Illegal object to clone\n");

          find_object()
            find_object2() <- avoid calling this again (for performance)
            load_object()

        inheritance: (compiler/grammar & lpc_compiler/grammar)
          ob = find_object2()

          if (ob->prog->flags & P_NO_INHERIT)
             yyerror("Illegal object to inherit\n");

        lex.c
          init pragma_no_inherit
               pragma_no_clone

        compiler/grammar & lpc_compiler/grammar
          set prog flags

-----

Implement compile stacks so we don't have to dump an object (and later
restart the compile) if an inherited object isn't defined yet.

Note: This would entail requiring the use of bison or pre-yacc'ed grammars
since most versions of yacc parsers aren't reentrant. -Beek

Actually, I take this back.  One could make the inherit rule look like:

inheritance: type_modifier_list L_INHERIT string_con1 ';'
    {
       ...
       ob = find_object2(file);
       if (ob == 0) {
           push_compiler_globals();
           lex_inherit_hook(file);
       } else {
           lex_loaded_inherit_hook();
       }
    }
  program terminator
    {
       ... import symbols ...
    }

terminator:
    L_ALREADY_LOADED
  | L_JUST_LOADED
    {
       pop_compiler_globals();
    }

etc ... lex_inherit_hook() cues lex to push it's globals and start a new
file; lex_loaded_inherit_hook() cues lex to just return L_ALREADY_LOADED
as the next token (note: in deep inherits this could require a rather
deep yacc stack)

Use parse trees to simplify compile time optimizations.

Rewrite strings to use counted strings (strlen and refcount).

Set up grammar dir for pre-byacc'd and/or pre-bison'd parsers for people
  with broken 'yacc's.

Support L_ARRAY_CLOSE, L_FUNCTION_CLOSE, and L_MAPPING_CLOSE for consistency;
L_MAPPING_CLOSE requires a bit more work...

Add an option to log the amount of input/output.

Comment:
number of packets and total output is already logged; it's hidden off in a
corner tho.  A better interface for the mud info stuff, maybe?

Add params to call_out_info() to limit info to particular functions
and/or objects.

Use shared string comparison in searching for commands

A make_mapping() efun that obeys the tautology:

make_mapping( keys(m), values(m) ) == m

-----

include_list() efun; also, BINARIES saves a list of includes, but error
line numbers do as well; the former should be modified to use the latter's
list (which was added after binaries were)

-----

Anonymous functions which do not reference globals etc should be rebindable.
Currently, non of the are, because the compile time checks aren't done.

I.e. bind(function(int i){return i;}, this_player())

should work.

-----

How about:

private:

int foo;

void bar() { ... }

need some way to turn it off, tho, since 'public' has a different meaning.
(i.e. there is no specifier for the 'no modifier' state.)

-----

varargs foo(int bar, int *rest ... ) 

foo(1, 2, 3) would give bar == 1, rest = ({ 2, 3 })

Also allow foo( ({ 1, 2 })... ) ?

-----

foreach (i, x in ({ 1, 2 }))

foreach (x in ([ 1 : 2, 3 : 4 ]))
