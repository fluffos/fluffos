The only commands in this little mudlib are:

	dest, update, ed, eval, efun, rm, say, who, quit, and shutdown.

All of update, dest, ed, and rm require full pathnames as arguments.

More commands:
tests : run a series test to validate driver function.
speed : run a benchmark.
crasher: calling efun with random argument, attempt to crash driver.

Have fun.
