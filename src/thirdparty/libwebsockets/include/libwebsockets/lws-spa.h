/** \defgroup form-parsing  Form Parsing
 * \ingroup http
 * ##POSTed form parsing functions
 *
 * These lws_spa (stateful post arguments) apis let you parse and urldecode
 * POSTed form arguments, both using simple urlencoded and multipart transfer
 * encoding.
 *
 * It's capable of handling file uploads as well a named input parsing,
 * and the apis are the same for both form upload styles.
 *
 * You feed it a list of parameter names and it creates pointers to the
 * urldecoded arguments: file upload parameters pass the file data in chunks to
 * a user-supplied callback as they come.
 *
 * Since it's stateful, it handles the incoming data needing more than one
 * POST_BODY callback and has no limit on uploaded file size.
