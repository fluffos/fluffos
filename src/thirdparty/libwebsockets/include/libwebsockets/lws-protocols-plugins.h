 * A list of protocols can be passed in at context creation time, but it is

 * Plugins are much preferable compared to cut and pasting code into an

 * the two sides belong together, and search through all the instantiated
 * vhost-protocols looking for a match.  If found, the private allocation
 * (aka "vhd" of the match is returned).  NULL is returned on no match.
 *
 * Since this can only succeed when called by the last of the two
 * protocols to be instantiated, both sides should call it and handle
 * NULL gracefully, since it may mean that they were first and their
 * partner vhsot-protocol has not been instantiated yet.
