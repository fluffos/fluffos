HTTP compression
----------------

This directory contains generic compression transforms that can be applied to
specifically HTTP content streams, after the header, be it h1 or h2.

The compression transforms expose an "ops" type struct and a compressor name
as used by `content-encoding`... the ops struct definition can be found in
./private.h.

Because the compression transform depends on being able to send on its output
before it can process new input, the transform adds a new kind of buflist
`wsi->buflist_comp` that represents pre-compression transform data
("input data" from the perspective of the compression transform) that was
delivered to be processed but couldn't be accepted.

Currently, zlib 'deflate' and brotli 'br' are supported on the server side.
