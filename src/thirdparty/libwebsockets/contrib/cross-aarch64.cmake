# Different build system distros set release optimization level to different
# things according to their local policy, eg, Fedora is -O2 and Ubuntu is -O3
# here.  Actually the build system's local policy is completely unrelated to
# our desire for cross-build release optimization policy for code built to run
# on a completely different target than the build system itself.
#
# Since this goes last on the compiler commandline we have to override it to a
# sane value for cross-build here.  Notice some gcc versions enable broken
# optimizations with -O3.
