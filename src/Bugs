heart_beat() is not shadowable

need a way to tell the driver to try reconnecting to the addr_server
after it has gone down and come back up (the addr_server).  maybe
the driver could just retry every now and then?

read_file() doesn't guarantee that a "/" is at the start of the filename
before passing to valid_read()...same problem might exist with
write_file(), read_bytes(), write_bytes(), didn't check yet

Comment:
    This problem is rather common in the driver currently.  Internally,
    filenames have no leading '/'.  One should probably be added every time
    a filename is passed to the mudlib.

hm, Linux apparently doesn't let you open a directory for reading. boggle.
so all the efuns that read from a file will screw up if you try
to use a dir as the file.  ack

    sprintf.c should probably be rewritten as it has a nasty habit of
    munging the stack and writing to places without checking the destination
    type if it's ok; probably should also remove need for setjmp/longjmp;
    also: err = setjmp(...) is non strict ANSI portable according to SAS
    tech support for their C compiler (SAS/C)

    mixed a;
    do {} while (a = ({ a, "" }));

Comment:
    It would be nice if things like this, where all the memory (VM too)
    is sucked up by a runaway program, didn't cause the driver to
    shutdown ("Out of memory").

-----

Currently, binaries are not checked to see if they are out of date with
respect to the simul_efun object, causing wierd behavior of binaries of
the order of the simuls changes, and then a binary is loaded.

------

edit_source should check for the existence of a.out to see if compilation
succeeded.  The exit code of the compiler is correct alot, but not on
all systems.  Should probably use -o somefile instead of assuming a.out
as well.

-----

Line numbers get messed up when files don't end in a newline?

-----

Range/switch search should be binary, not linear. (in LPC->C)

-----

strings longer than MAXSHORT screw up statistics, b/c their length is counted
inconsistently.

-----

Probably need a test to see if bison's output actually compiles in
./build.Mudos;  on alot of AIX systems bison's use of alloca() fails.

The current implementation of swapping could use alot of work.  Swapping
an object in/out isn't that expensive CPU wise, and can save a decent amount
of memory.  The problem is that cloned programs can't swap, which disables
swapping for much of the mud ...

replace_string(implode(({"east", "west", "foo", "arg"}), ", "), ", ", " and ", 3, 4)

=> eastwestfoo and arg
