The file "Artistic" is included because a small part of the driver source
is derived from Larry Wall's Perl package (namely the hashing code
used in the mappings implementation).  Previously, we used the GNU Copyleft
because the "Artistic" option wasn't then available.  Since the "Artistic"
license is more similar to Lars Pensk|'s original Copyright than is the GNU
Copyleft, we have chosen to use Artistic instead of the Copyleft (as
is allowed by the terms Larry Wall sets forth in the Perl 4.036 README).
Where there is any conflict between Lars' copyright and the Artistic license,
Lars' copyright should take precedence.
