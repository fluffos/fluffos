## Environment

v2019 supports building on ubuntu 18.04+ (including WSL), and OSX latest, MSYS2/mingw64.

Compilers: FluffOS v2019 uses C++17 and C11, which requires at least GCC 7+ or LLVM clang 4+.

System Library Requirement:
1. Libevent 2.0+.
1. ICU: FluffOS uses ICU for UTF-8 and transcoding support.
1. jemalloc: Release build use JEMALLOC by default, and is highly recommended in production.
1. OpenSSL (if PACAKGE_CRYPTO enabled)
1. PCRE (if PACKGAGE_PCRE enabled)
1. MysqlClient (if PACKAGE_DB enabled)

Bundled thirdparty library:
1. libtelnet: telnet protocol support
1. libwebsocket: websocket support.
1. ghc filesystem: polyfill for std::filesystem
1. backward-cpp: stacktrace
1. utf8_decoder_dfa: fast utf8 validation.
1. widecharwidth: wcwidth with unicode 11

## BUILD (v2019)

Ubuntu 18.04

This is the best platform to build & run FluffOS, support for other platform
is best effort only.

    # Install all libs
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install build-essential bison \
    libevent-dev libmysqlclient-dev libpcre3-dev libpq-dev \
    libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libz-dev libjemalloc-dev

To Build fluffOS v2019 (CMake)

    # 1. checkout git repo
    $ git clone https://github.com/fluffos/fluffos.git
    $ cd fluffos
    $ git checkout v2019 #(or an v2019 release tag)

    # 2. Upgrade your cmake
    $ sudo pip install --upgrade cmake

    # 3. build
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make install

    # 4. find the two built binary and websocket www directory in ./bin/

Packages

    # By default driver have an default list of builtin packages to build.
    # If you want to turn off an package, run cmake .. -DPACKAGE_XX=OFF -DPACAGE_YY=OFF

Advanced Build features (v2019)

    # By default driver in release mode will optimize for running on current CPU only.
    # if you wish to cross compile for other machines, turn off MARCH_NATIVE.

    $ cmake .. -DMARCH_NATIVE=OFF

    # Then you can copy driver to another server with different CPU and it still works.

    # Static linking: you can pass -DSTATIC=ON to force driver to link staticly for all libraries, this will only work
    # in a specilized enviroment like alpine linux for now.

    # Check the result file to make sure it is an static file

    $ ldd bin/driver
    not a dynamic executable

## OSX
    # 1. Install Homebrew, goto https://brew.sh/ and follow instructions!

    # 2. install libraries (checkout https://github.com/fluffos/fluffos/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-osx.yml if
     you have issue)
    $ brew install cmake pkg-config mysql pcre libgcrypt libevent openssl jemalloc icu4c

    # 3. build same as under linux, you will need to pass two environment variables
    $ make build && cd build
    $ OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR="/usr/local/opt/openssl" ICU_ROOT="/usr/local/opt/icu4c" cmake ..
    $ make install
