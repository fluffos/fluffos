### SYNOPSIS

    varargs int memory_info( object ob );

### DESCRIPTION

    If  optional argument 'ob' is given, memory_info() returns the approxi‚Äê
    mate amount of memory that 'ob' is using.  If  no  argument  is  given,
    memory_info()  returns the approximate amount of memory that the entire

    necessarily  correspond  to  the amount of memory actually allocated by
    the mud from the system.
