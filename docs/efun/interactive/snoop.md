### NAME

    snoop() - snoop an interactive user

### SYNOPSIS

    varargs object snoop( object snooper, object snoopee );

### DESCRIPTION

    When   both  arguments  are  used,  begins  snooping  of  'snoopee'  by
    'snooper'.  If the second argument is omitted, turns off  all  snooping
    by  'snoopee'.   Security  for  snoop()  is  normally  controlled  by a
    simul_efun.  snoop() returns 'snoopee' if successful in  the  two-argu‚Äê
    ment  case,  and  'snooper' if it was successful in the single-argument
    case.  A return of 0 indicates failure.
