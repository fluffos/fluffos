### NAME

    present() - find an object by id

### SYNOPSIS

    object present( mixed str, object ob );

### DESCRIPTION

    if first argument is string, second argument is missing, searches for
    a object in the object's environment using the id() apply where it answers 1
    to indicate a match.

    if  first  argument is string, second argument is object, only searches
    for target in that object's inventory using the same strategy as above.

    "foo 1" means the first "foo" in  the  inventory.   the  first  in  the
    inventory is the last object that moved in.

    if  first  argument  is  object, second argument is missing, check if
    object is in this object's inventory, or as a sibling in this  object's
    environment's inventory, returns object's parent.  

    if first argument is  object,  second  argument  is  object,  check  if
    object1 is in object2 inventory, return object1 if true.

    If  object  is  hidden (via set_hide()), and current object is not hid‚Äê
    able.  returns 0
