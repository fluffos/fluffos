### NAME

    reload_object - return an object to its just-loaded state

### SYNOPSIS

    void reload_object( object ob );

### DESCRIPTION

    When reload_object() is called on 'ob', all the driver-maintained prop‚Äê
    erties are re-initialized (heart_beat, call_outs, light, shadows, etc),
    all  variables  are  re-initialized,  and create() is called.  It has a
    similar effect to destructing/reloading the object,  however,  no  disk
    access or parsing is performed.

### SEE ALSO

    export_uid(3), new(3), clone_object(3), destruct(3)
