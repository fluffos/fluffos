### NAME

    preload - preload an object into memory.

### SYNOPSIS

    string *epilog( int load_empty );
    void preload( string filename );

### DESCRIPTION

    The  driver  calls  epilog() in master after the master object has been
    loaded.  Mudlibs typically use epilog to initialize data structures  in
    master (such as security tables etc).  epilog() should returns an array
    of filenames which correspond to objects that the mudlib wants to  have
    preloaded;  that  is, loaded before the first player logs in.  For each
    filename returned in the array, the driver  will  called  preload(file‐
    name) in master.

    The  variable  'load_empty'  is non-zero if the -e option was specified
    when starting up the driver.  It can be used as a signal to the  mudlib
    to not load castles, etc.
