  read_file("""This command will show the most favored religion of Threshold. All other
churches are listed in order of their approach to this esteemed position
as well.

Favor is gained by the actions of clerics and paladins and other members of
the faith in the day to day lives and actions. Even the undevoted can have
a sincere impact on ascent of a church to be the most favored.

If your church is favored, any time you kill a monster, 10% of its dropped
coin is calculated and contributed to your temple as a tithe. This, however,
is only a mechanic of partying. It is to encourage grouping with your faith-
mates, but it will work regardless of the religious makeup of the party.

Your church's progress can be seen via the religion command (help religion).
