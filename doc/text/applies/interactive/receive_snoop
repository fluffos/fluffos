receive_snoop - catch incoming snoop text

void receive_snoop(string message);

If RECEIVE_SNOOP is defined in options.h or  local_options,
whenever a user is snooping another
user, all snoop text is sent to receive_snoop() in their user object.  Inside
of this function, you can do as you wish with the text.  A common activity
would be to receive() it.
