catch_tell - provides an interface to interact with users

void catch_tell( string message );

If INTERACTIVE_CATCH_TELL is defined in options.h, whenever the driver
has something to tell an object due to say(), shout(), tell_object(), etc.
catch_tell in the player object will be called with the message to
be printed.  The message can be displayed, discarded, or modified in
any way desired.  This is a useful way to have flexible earmuffs, or
to support intelligent clients.
