telnet_suboption - process telnet suboptions

void telnet_suboption( string buf );

This apply is called on the interactive object with the parameter given
by the SE telnet suboption, for mudlib defined processing.  Note that
terminal type responses and window size responses are interpreted and
sent to terminal_type() and window_size() respectively instead of going
through telnet_suboption().

The first byte of the buffer is typically a type descriptor,
ie TELOPT_TTYPE. The next byte is a procession option, such
as TELQUAL_IS.  Following this is the type dependent data.
