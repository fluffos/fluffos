terminal_type - inform the mudlib of the user's terminal type

void terminal_type( string term );

This apply is called on the interactive object with term set to the
terminal type for the user, as reported by telnet negotiation.  If the
user's client never responds (it's not telnet, for example) this will
never be called.
