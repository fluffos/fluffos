receive_message - provides the interface used by the message efun.

void receive_message( mixed cl, mixed message );

The message() efun calls this method in the player object.  The cl
parameter is typically used to indicate the class (say, tell, emote,
combat, room description, etc) of the message.  The receive_message() 
apply together with the message() efun can provide a good mechanism for
interfacing with a "smart" client.
