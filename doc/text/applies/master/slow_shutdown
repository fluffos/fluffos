slow_shutdown - informs the mud that a slow shutdown is in progress

int slow_shutdown( int minutes );

This master apply is called when the driver can't
allocate any more memory from the heap and had to
use its reserved memory block.  This function can
only be called if the "reserved size" config file
setting was set.  The minutes remaining to driver
shutdown is passed to this function.  If this function
does ont exist, or returns zero, the driver shuts
down immediately.
