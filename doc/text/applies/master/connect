connect - get an object for a new user

object connect(int port);

The driver calls connect() in the master object whenever a new user logs
into the driver.  port is the actual port connected to; for example if
you have two login ports defined as 2000 and 3000, either 2000 or 3000 
will be passed to this routine.

The object returned by connect() is used as the initial
user object.  Note that it is possible to change the user object at a later
time (for example, after determining who is logging in) using the exec()
efun.
