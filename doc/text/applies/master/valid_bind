valid_bind - determine if it is legal to bind a given function pointer to an object

int valid_bind(object doer, object owner, object victim); 

This is called when 'doer' tries to use the bind() efun to bind a function
pointer owned by 'owner' to the object 'victim'.  If this routine returns
zero, the operation is disallowed.
