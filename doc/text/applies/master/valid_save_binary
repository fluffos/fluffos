valid_save_binary - controls whether or not an object can save its loaded program

int valid_save_binary( string file ); 

This routine is only used when BINARIES are enabled.

When the driver is compiled with ALWAYS_SAVE_BINARIES, or an object uses
'#pragma save_binary', valid_save_binary is called with the program's filename.
If valid_save_binary returns 1, then the program will be saved to disk for
faster reloading, otherwise it will not be saved, and the next reload will
recompile as usual.
