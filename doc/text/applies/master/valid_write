valid_write - checks if a certain object has write permission on a file

int valid_write( string file, object ob, string func );

Every time an object tries to write a file, the driver calls valid_write
in the master object to check if the write should be allowed.  The
arguments are the filename, the object making the write, and
the calling function name (usually the name of the efun being used).
If valid_write returns non-zero, the write is allowed.
