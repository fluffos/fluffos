valid_socket - protects the socket efunctions

int valid_socket( object caller, string function, mixed array info );

Each of the socket efunctions calls valid_socket() prior to executing.
If valid_socket returns 0, then the socket efunction fails.  If
valid_socket returns 1, then the socket efunction attempts to succeed.
The first argument 'caller' is the object that called the socket efunction.
The second argument is the name of the socket efunction that is being
called (e.g. socket_write() or socket_bind()).  The third argument is
an array of information.  The first element of the array (when applicable)
is file descriptor being referenced.  The second element of the array
is the owner of the socket (object).  The third element of the array is
the address (string) of the remote end of the socket.  The fourth element
of the array is the port number associated with the socket.
