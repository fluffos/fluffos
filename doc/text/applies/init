init - function in an object called by move_object() to initialize verb/actions

void init();

This function is not called if NO_ADD_ACTIONS is defined.

When the mudlib moves an object "A" inside another object "B", the
driver (the move_object() efunction) does the following:

<DL>
* if "A" is living, causes "A" to call the init() in "B"
* causes each living object in the inventory of "B" to call init() in
"A".  regardless of whether "A" is living or not.
* if "A" is living, causes "A" to call the init() in each object in
the inventory of "B".
</DL>

Note: an object is considered to be living if enable_commands() has
been called by that object.

Typically, the init() function in an object is used to call add_action()
for each command that the object offers.
