Applies

Applies are functions called by the driver in objects when certain events
occur, as opposed to functions called in objects by other objects.
In most cases, these functions can be called even if they are private or
static, allowing one to prevent them from being called by anything else.

General applies:

<DL>
*  __INIT
*  clean_up
*  create
*  id
*  init
*  move_or_destruct
*  reset
</DL>

Subcategories:

<DL>
*  master
*  parsing
*  interactive
</DL>
