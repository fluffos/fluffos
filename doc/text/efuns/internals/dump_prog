dump_prog - dump/disassemble an LPC object

void dump_prog( object ob, int flags, string file );

This efun is only available when PACKAGE_DEVELOP is compiled into the driver.

dump_prog() dumps information about the program of `obj' to a file,
`file', or "/PROG_DUMP" if `file' is not given.  If the current object
does not have write access to the file, it fails.  

Flags can be a combination of the following values:
<DL>
* 1 - include a disassembly of the i-code
* 2 - include line number information
</DL>
