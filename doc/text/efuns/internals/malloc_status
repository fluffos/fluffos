malloc_status - report various statistics related to memory usage.

string malloc_status();

This function returns memory usage statistics in a string.
This function replaces the hardcoded 'malloc' command in vanilla 3.1.2.
Note that the output produced by malloc_status() depends upon which
memory management package is chosen in options.h when building the driver.
