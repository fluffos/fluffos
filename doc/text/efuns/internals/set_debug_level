set_debug_level - sets the debug level used by the driver's debug() macro

void set_debug_level( int level );

This efun is only available when the driver is compiled with -DDEBUG_MACRO.
The purpose of this efun is to allow the amount and type of debugging
information produced to be controlled from within the mud (while the
driver is running).

For more information, read the file debug.h which is included with the
driver source.
