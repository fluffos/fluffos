debugmalloc - dumps information on malloc'd memory to a file

void debugmalloc(string filename, int mask);

This efun is only available when PACKAGE_DEVELOP, DEBUGMALLOC and DEBUGMALLOC_EXTENSIONS are
both defined in options.h at driver build time.  The debugmalloc() efun
will dump information on those chunks of memory allocated by DMALLOC() and
related macros if the bitwise and (&) with the tag supplied by the macro
(i.e. (mask & tag)) is non-zero.  Read md.c and config.h in the
driver source for more information.
