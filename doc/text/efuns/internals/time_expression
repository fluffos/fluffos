time_expression - return the amount of real time that an expression took

int time_expression( mixed expr );

int time_expression { ... } 

Evaluate <expr> or the specified block of code.  The amount of real time
that passes during the evaluation of <expr>, in microseconds, is returned.
The precision of the value is
not necessarily 1 microsecond; in fact, it probably is much less precise.
