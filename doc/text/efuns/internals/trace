int trace( int traceflags );

This efun is only available if TRACE and PACKAGE_DEVELOP are compiled in.

When tracing is on a lot of information is printed during execution.

The trace bits are:

* 2 - Trace all calls to "call_other".
* 4 - Trace all function returns.
* 8 - Print arguments at function calls and return values.
* 16 - Print all executed stack machine instructions (produces a lot of output!).
* 32 - Enable trace in heart beat functions.
* 64 - Trace calls to apply.
* 128 - Show object name in tracing.
