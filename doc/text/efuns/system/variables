variables - list all the variables in a given object.

string array variables(object, int default: 0);

variables() can return two different things. If the second argument is
0 (which it is by default) it will return an array containing the names
of all the variables in the object passed as the first argument. If the
second argument is non-zero, more information about each variable is
given. For a non-zero second argument, each array element contains
the following:

({ variable_name, variable_type }). 

Where variable_name is the name of the given variable, and variable_type
is the type of the variable, such as "string" or "private int" etc.

This efun is only available if PACKAGE_CONTRIB is defined in the
options file.
