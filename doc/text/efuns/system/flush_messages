flush_messages - send all pending messages to a user

int flush_messages();

int flush_messages(object user);

Normally, messages are queued, then sent all at once to minimize the
number of packets required.  This efun forces all pending messages to
be written immediately.  If no user is specified, messages for ALL users
are flushed.
