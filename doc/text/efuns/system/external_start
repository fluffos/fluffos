external_start - start an external command

int external_start(int which, string args, mixed read_cb, mixed write_cb, mixed close_cb);

'which' specifies which of the 5 external commands specified in
the config file to run.  'args' are the arguments to pass to the
command.  The driver then starts up the specified command, and sets up
an LPC socket to communicate with the input and output of the command.
The file descriptor of the LPC socket is returned.
