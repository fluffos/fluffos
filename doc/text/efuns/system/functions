functions - list all the functions in a given object.

string array functions(object, int default: 0);

functions() can return two different things. If the second argument is
0 (which it is by default) it will return an array containing the names
of all the functions in the object passed as the first argument. If the
second argument is non-zero, more information about each function is
given. For a non-zero second argument, each array element contains
the following:

({ function_name, number_of_arguments, return_type, ... }). 

Where the fourth and following elements are the argument types.  If
the save_types pragma was not in effect when the function was compiled,
number_of_arguments will be correct, but no types will be available.

This efun is only available if PACKAGE_CONTRIB is defined in the
options file.
