bind - bind a function pointer to a new object

function bind(function, object);

bind() causes a function to become owned by the new object.  This changes
the value of this_object() when the function pointer is evaluated.  Functions
that reference global variables or functions in the object that created
them cannot be rebound.  Binding a function to the object it is already
bound to will never fail.

Permission to use this efun is controlled by the valid_bind() master apply.
