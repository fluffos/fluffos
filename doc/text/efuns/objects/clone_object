clone_object - load a copy of an object

object clone_object( string name, ... );

object new( string name, ... );

Create a new object from the file 'name', and give it a new unique
name (by adding #xxx on to the end of the name).  Returns the new object.
The object shares the program of the object 'name', but has its own
set of variables.  The second and following arguments are passed to
create()
