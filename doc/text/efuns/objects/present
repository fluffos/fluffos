present - find an object by id

object present( mixed str);

object present( mixed str, object ob );

This efun is only available if NO_ENVIRONMENT is not compiled in.

If an object for which id(str) returns true exists, return it.

`str' can also be an object, in 'str' is searched for, instead of calling
the function id().

If `ob' is given, then the search is done in the inventory of `ob', otherwise
the object is searched for in the inventory of the current object, and
in the inventory of the environment of the current object.
