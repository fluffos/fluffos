set_hide - set the hide flag on a hidable object

void set_hide( int flag );

Sets the hidden flag of an object to `flag', which should be 0 or 1
(hide disable, or hide enable, respectively).  Only objects for which
`master()->valid_hide(ob)' returns true may make themselves hidden.
When the object is hidden, only other hidable objects will be able to
find the object with find_object(), or multiple-object returning efuns such
as users(), children(), all_inventory(), etc.
