set_heart_beat - enable or disable an object's heartbeat

int set_heart_beat( int flag );

Passing 'flag' as 0 disables the object's heart beat.  Passing a 'flag' of
1 will cause heart_beat() to be called in the object once each heart beat
(a variable number defined by your local administrator, usually 2 seconds).
Passing a 'flag' of greater than 1 will usually set the number of heart beats
in between calls to heart_beat(), however your local administrator may have
the system configured to treat any 'flag' above 1 as 1.
