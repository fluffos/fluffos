destruct - remove an object

void destruct( object ob );

Completely destroy and remove object 'ob'. After the call to destruct().
If 'ob' is this_object(), execution will continue, but it is best to return
a value immediately.  All pointers to the object in any variable or structure
will immediately become zero.  move_or_destruct() is called in all the
objects inside of the object being destructed.
