save_object - save the values of variables in an object into a file

int save_object( string name, int flag );

Save all values of non-static variables in this object in the file 'name'.
valid_write() in the master object determines whether this is allowed.
If the optional second argument is 1, then variables that are zero (0) are also
saved (normally, they aren't).  Object variables and function pointers
always save as 0.  save_object() returns 1 for success, 0 for failure.
