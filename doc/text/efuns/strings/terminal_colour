terminal_colour - replaces codes in a string

string terminal_colour(string str, mapping m, int wrap, int indent);

terminal_colour() replaces each occurrence of %^key%^ in str with 'value',
where 'key' and 'value' are the elements in the mapping m.

'wrap' is the optional column number to wrap at, and 'indent' is the
amount to indent the second and following lines.  Codes are assumed to
change the mode of the terminal and not generate any printable
characters for the purposes of wrapping.

This efun is only available if PACKAGE_CONTRIB is defined.
