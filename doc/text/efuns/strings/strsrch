strsrch - search for substrings in a string

int strsrch( string str, string substr | int char, int flag );

strsrch() searches for the first occurance of the string 'substr' in the 
string 'str'.  The last occurance of 'substr' can be found by passing '-1' 
as the 3rd argument (which is optional).  If the second argument is an 
integer, that character is found (like C's strchr()/strrchr().)  The empty 
string or null value cannot be searched for.

The integer offset of the first (last) match is returned.  -1 is returned
if there was no match, or an error occurred (bad args, etc).
