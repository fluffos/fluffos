map_mapping - modify an mapping of elements via application of a function

mapping map_mapping( mapping map, string fun, object ob, ... );

mapping map_mapping( mapping map, function f, ... );

Returns an mapping with the same keys as map whose items have been
mapped throught 'ob->fun()' or 'f'.  The function is called for each
(key, value) pair in 'map' and the returned mapping has the return value
of the function as its value for each key.
The extra arguments are passed as parameters to the function
after the key and the value.
