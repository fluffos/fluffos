socket_bind - bind a name to a socket

int socket_bind( int s, int port );

This efun is only available if PACKAGE_SOCKETS is compiled in.

socket_bind() assigns a name to an unnamed socket. When a socket is
created with socket_create() it exists in a name space (address family)
but has no name assigned. socket_bind() requests that the port be assigned
to the socket s.

socket_bind() returns:

EESUCCESS on success.

a negative value indicated below on error.
