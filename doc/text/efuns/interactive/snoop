snoop - snoop an interactive user

varargs object snoop( object snooper, object snoopee );

When both arguments are used, begins snooping of `snoopee' by
`snooper'.  If the second argument is omitted, turns off all snooping
by `snoopee'.  Security for snoop() is normally controlled by a
simul_efun.  snoop() returns `snoopee' if successful in the
two-argument case, and `snooper' if it was successful in the
single-argument case.  A return of 0 indicates failure.
The 'snoopee' must be an interactive object; the snooper can be any
object.  However, snooping with a non-interactive object is useless
unless the RECEIVE_SNOOP option is enabled, and the object defines
a RECEIVE_SNOOP function.
