query_ip_name - return the ip name of a given player object.

string query_ip_name( object ob );

Return the IP address for player `ob'.  An asynchronous process `addr_server'
is used to find out these name in parallel.  If there are any failures to
find the ip-name, then the ip-number is returned instead.
