to_int - convert a float or buffer to an int

int to_int( float x );
int to_int( buffer x );
int to_int( string x );

If 'x' is a float, the to_int() call returns the number of type 'int' that is 
equivalent to 'x' (with any decimal stripped off).  If 'x' is a buffer, the
call returns the integer (in network-byte-order) that is embedded in the
buffer.  If 'x' is a string, then the string is converted to an integer.
An undefined value is returned if the string is not a valid number.
