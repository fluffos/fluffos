set_author - set the author associated with an object

void set_author( string author );

Every object has both an author and a domain associated with it for
the purposes of tracking statistics for authors and domains.  Domains
may only be set in the master object function domain_file(), however
authors are different.  They can be initialized to some default value
by author_file() in the master object, but can also be changed using
the set_author efun.

set_author changes the author of the object that it is called within.
That author will get credit for all future actions of that object that
affect mudlib statistics.
