set_light - update or query an object's light level

int set_light( int light_level_adjustment );

This efun is only available if NO_LIGHT is not compiled in.

Passing 'light_level_adjustment' as 0 queries the object's current
light level.  A positive number will increase the light level, while
a negative number will decrease the light level.

Note that the object's current light level includes the light it sees from
other objects.

This efun is provided mostly for backwards compatibility; it really should
be handled by the mudlib.
