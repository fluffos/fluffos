previous_object - returns the object(s) that called the current function

object previous_object(); 
mixed previous_object(int x); 

Returns an object pointer to the object, if any, that called current function.
Note that local function calls do not set previous_object() to the current
object, but leave it unchanged.  If passed a positive integer, it goes back
the given number of previous objects in the calling chain.
previous_object(0) is the same as previous_object(), previous_object(1) is
the previous object's previous_object(), etc.  previous_object(-1) returns
an array containing all of the previous objects.
