.SH NAME
get_include_path - decide include path based on object

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
mixed get_include_path( string object_path );

.SH DESCRIPTION
When the driver starts to compile a new object this apply is used to
determine what directories are to be searched for include files.
In contrast to the static run time configuration option 'include directories'
this allows for a dynamic approach based on the storage place.

The argument to this apply is the absolute path of the object to be compiled,
return value is an array of strings with it's elements either the absolute
path to the desired include directories or the special string ":DEFAULT:"
which will be replaced be the include path as set by the runtime
configuration of the driver.

.SH EXAMPLE
string *get_include_path(string file)
{
    string *t = explode(file, "/");
    if(t[1] == "Domain")    // Domains have their own include directory
        return ({ "/Domain/" + t[2] + "/include", ":DEFAULT:" });
    else                    // use default for others
        return ({ ":DEFAULT:" });
}
