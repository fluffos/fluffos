.SH NAME
domain_file - determine the domain for a given object

.SH SYNOPSIS
string domain_file( string file );

.SH DESCRIPTION
This function must exist in the master object.  It is called by the
domain statistic functions in the driver to determine what domain a
given object should be associated with.  This is totally arbitrary and
up to the mudlib designers wishes.  It should be noted that the domain
that the object is assigned to will receive "credit" for all of the
objects behavior (errors, heart_beats, worth, etc).

At startup the driver will ask for the backbone domain by calling
domain_file("/").
