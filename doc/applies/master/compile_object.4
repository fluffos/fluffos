.SH NAME
compile_object - serves as the mudlib interface for the virtual object facility

.SH SYNOPSIS
object compile_object( string pathname );

.SH DESCRIPTION
The driver calls compile_object(3) in the event that the mudlib instructs
the driver to load a file that does not exist.  For example, the driver
will call compile_object("/obj/file.r") in master if the mudlib calls
call_other("/obj/file.r", "some_function") or new("/obj/file.r")
and /obj/file.r.c names a file that does not exist.  The compile_object()
function is expected to return 0 if the mudlib does not wish to
associate an object with the file name "/obj/file.r".  If the mudlib
does wish to associate an object with the filename "/obj/file.r", then
the mudlib should return the object it wishes associated.  After an
association is made between an object and a filename, then it will be
as if the file, file.r.c, did exist (to the driver) and when loaded produced
the object that compile_object() returned.
