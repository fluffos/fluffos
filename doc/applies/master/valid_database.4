.SH NAME
valid_database - protects the database efunctions.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
mixed valid_database( object caller, string function, mixed *info );

.SH DESCRIPTION
Each of the database efunctions calls valid_database() prior to executing.
If valid_database returns 0, then the database efunction fails.  If
valid_database returns 1, then the database efunction attempts to succeed.
The first argument 'caller' is the object that called the database efunction.
The second argument is the name of the database efunction that is being
called (e.g. db_connect() or db_commit()).  The third argument, if
applicable, is an array of additional information.  Currently this is used
for efun::db_connect with the form
({ string database, string host, string user })
and for efund::dh_exec with the form
({ string sql_query })

Returns 0 if the use of the efun is to be disallowed, for efun::db_connect it
should return the password to be used for the connect and 1 otherwise

.SH SEE ALSO
db_connect(3), db_exec(3)
