<b> array localtime( int time ); </b>
<p>
localtime() converts a time value (as returned by time()) into an array
of values which represents the time locally.  In the past time() was used
to get the time in GMT (UTC), and then local definitions were used to
determine the local offset from GMT.  This roundabout approach is no
longer necessary.  localtime() returns the seconds, minutes and hours,
the day, month and year, day of the week, day of the year,
the name of the local timezone and how far the MUD is from GMT.  This
information is retrieved directly from the operating system and made
available to the driver without the use of MUD-specific configuration
files.
<p>
localtime() returns an array containing the values specified above.
The index for each value is defined symbolically in localtime.h.  The
following table summarizes the array returned by localtime().
<pre>
	int	LT_SEC		Seconds after the minute (0..59)
	int	LT_MIN		Minutes after the hour (0..59)
	int	LT_HOUR		Hour since midnight (0..23)
	int	LT_MDAY		Day of the month (1..31)
	int	LT_MON		Months since January (0..11)
	int	LT_YEAR		Year (guarenteed to be >= 1900)
	int	LT_WDAY		Days since Sunday (0..6)
	int	LT_YDAY		Days since January 1 (0..365)
	int	LT_GMTOFF	Seconds after GMT (UTC)
	string	LT_ZONE		Timezone name
