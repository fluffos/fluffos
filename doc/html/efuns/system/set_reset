set_reset - modify the time until reset on an object

varargs void set_reset( object ob, int time );

This efun is only available if NO_RESETS is not compiled in.

Sets the time until reset on 'ob' to 'time' seconds from now.  If 'time'
is omitted, the driver's normal reset time setting formula is applied
to 'ob', that is,
<pre>
reset time = current_time + reset_time / 2 + random(reset_time / 2)
</pre>
