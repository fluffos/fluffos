shutdown - shutdown the driver

void shutdown( int how );

This function shuts down the driver in a controlled fashion (as opposed to
how a crash would shut it down).  The 'how' argument specifes what integer
value that driver should pass to exit().  The convention is to pass 'how'
as -1 when the script that restarts the driver should die as well.  Thus
a reboot command would use shutdown() while a halt command would use
shutdown(-1).  The script must explicitly check the return value to see
if it is -1 if you wish to use this convention.  Obviously, shutdown()
is a sensitive function and should be secured.  As with exec(), the way
to make it secure is to add a simul_efun of the same name which does
the appropriate security checks.  Be sure to set valid_override() up
(in master.c) to protect against efun::shutdown().
