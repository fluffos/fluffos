reclaim_objects - reclaim any lingering objects

int reclaim_objects();

Cycles through all objects that are loaded, and frees any lingering objects
that it can.  This could result in a sizable amount of memory being freed up,
depending on how the mud is coded.  Objects are typically left lingering
when a global variable in more than one object contains a pointer to it,
and the object gets destructed, but the values containing pointers to the
object are never accessed again.  This efun returns the number of destructed
objects encountered in variables.
