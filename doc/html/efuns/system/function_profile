function_profile - get function profiling information for an object

array function_profile( object ob );

Returns function profiling information for 'ob', or this_object() if 'ob'
is not specified.  This is only available if the driver was compiled
with PROFILE_FUNCTIONS defined.

An array of mappings is returned, one for each function in 'ob'.  The format 
of the mapping is:
<pre>
       ([ "name"     : name_of_the_function,
          "calls"    : number_of_calls,

          "self"     : cpu_time_spent_in self,
          "children" : cpu_time_spent_in_children
       ])
</pre>
The usefulness of this is tied to the resolution of the CPU clock--even 
though the units are microseconds, the CPU timer resolution is often much 
less.
