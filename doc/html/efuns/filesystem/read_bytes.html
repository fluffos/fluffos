<b> string read_bytes( string path, int start, int length ); </b>
<p>
This function reads 'length' bytes beginning at byte # 'start' in the
file named 'path'.  The bytes are returned as a string.  Note that
(start + length) must not be past the end of the file or else read_bytes
will fail.  If the second and third arguments are omitted, the entire file
is returned.
