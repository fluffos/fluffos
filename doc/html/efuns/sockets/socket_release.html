This efun is only available if PACKAGE_SOCKETS is compiled in.
<p>
socket_release() is used to change ownership (and control) of a socket
to another object.  It is useful in daemon objects (like inetd) which
handle connection set-up and then transfer a connected socket to another
object for further processing.
<p>
Socket ownership transfer involves a handshake between the current owner
object and the socket to which the current owner wishes to transfer the
socket.  The handshake is initiated when socket_release() is called.
socket_release() does appropriate security/integrity checking and then
calls the release_callback function in object ob.  This function is used
to notify ob that socket ownership is being transferred to it.  It is
then ob's responsibility to call socket_acquire() within the release
callback function.  If socket_acquire() is called then the handshake is
complete and socket ownership has been successfully transferred to ob.
ob may decline to accept responsibility for the socket by not calling
socket_acquire(), in which case ownership does not change and the
current socket owner must decide how to respond to this.
<p>
If the socket owner is successfully transfered then socket_release()
returns EESUCCESS.  If ob does not accept ownership for the socket then
EESOCKNOTRLSD is returned (both in "socket_err.h").  Other errors can be returned based on
security violation, bad socket descriptor vbalues, etc.
