This efun is only available if PACKAGE_SOCKETS is compiled in.
<p>
socket_acquire() is called to complete the handshake begun by socket_release()
for transferring ownership (and control) of a socket to a new object.
socket_release() calls the release callback function within the new owner
object to notify the object that it wishes to pass control of the socket
on.  It is the responsibility of the new owner socket to decide whether
it wishes to accept the socket.  It it does, then socket_acquire() is
called to complete the transfer.  If not, then the callback simply returns
without completing the handshake.
<p>
In the former case the handshake is completed and the new object
becomes the socket owner.  The read, write and close callback function
parameters refer to functions within the new object.  These are specified
so that the MudOS driver will know which functions to call within the new
object.  Decling to acquire the socket will cause socket_release() to
return EESOCKNOTRLSD so the owner can perform appropriate clean-up.
EESOCKNOTRLSD is in "socket_err.h".
<p>
socket_acquire() may only be called within the context of thr release
callback function and only with the socket specified.
