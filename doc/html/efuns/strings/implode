implode - concatenate strings

string implode( array arr, string del );

mixed implode( array arr, function f);

mixed implode( array arr, function f, mixed start);

Concatenate all strings found in array 'arr', with the string 'del' between
each element. Only strings are used from the array.  Elements that are not
strings are ignored.

The second version takes the first and second values of arr and passes them
to f, then passes that result and the third arg to f, et cetera.  It returns
the last result of the call to f.

In the third case, the first call is f(start, arr[0]), then things proceed
as above.
