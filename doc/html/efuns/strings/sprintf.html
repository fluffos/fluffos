<b> string sprintf( string format, ... ); </b>
<p>
An implementation of sprintf() for LPC, with quite a few extensions
Originally implemented by Lynscar (Sean A Reith).
<p>
This version supports the following as modifiers:
<dl>
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> " " - pad positive integers with a space.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> "+" - pad positive integers with a plus sign.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> "-" - left adjusted within field size.
<b>Note:</b> sprintf() defaults to right justification, which is unnatural
in the context of a mainly string based language but has been retained for
"compatability".
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> "|" - centered within field size.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> "=" - column mode if width is greater than field size. This is only
meaningful with strings, all other types ignore this. Columns are
auto-magically word wrapped.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> "#" - table mode, print a list of '\\n' separated 'words' in a
table within the field size.  only meaningful with strings.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> a number - specifies the field size, a '*' specifies to use the
corresponding arg as the field size.  If n is prepended with a zero, then
the field is padded zeros, otherwise it is padded with spaces (or specified pad string; see below).
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> "." then a number - precision of n, simple strings truncate after this (if precision is
greater than field size, then field size = precision), tables use
precision to specify the number of columns (if precision not specified
then tables calculate a best fit), all other types ignore this.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> ":" then a number - n specifies the fs _and_ the precision, if n is prepended by a zero then the field is padded with zeros instead of spaces.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> "@" - the argument is an array.  the corresponding format_info (minus the "@") is applied to each element of the array.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> "'X'" - The char(s) between the single-quotes are used to pad to
field size (defaults to space) (if both a zero (in front of field
size) and a pad string are specified, the one specified second
overrules).  NOTE:  to include "'" in the pad string, you must
use "\'" (as the backslash has to be escaped past the
interpreter), similarly, to include "\" requires "\\\\".
</dl>
The following are the possible type specifiers.
<dl>
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> % - in which case no arguments are interpreted, and a "%" is
inserted, and all modifiers are ignored.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> O - the argument is an LPC datatype.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> s - the argument is a string.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> d, i - the integer arg is printed in decimal.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> c - the integer arg is to be printed as a character.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> o - the integer arg is printed in octal.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> x - the integer arg is printed in hex.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> X - the integer arg is printed in hex (with A-F in capitals).
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> f - floating point number
