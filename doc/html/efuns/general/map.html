<p>
The (ob, fun) syntax works as if (: call_other, ob, fun :) had been passed as
f.  Map returns a new structure containing the return values of f being applied
to each element of x.  Currently, it can be used on arrays, mappings and
strings.  In the case of mappings, both the key and the value are passed
to the function.  In the case of strings, the characters are passed to the
function one at a time as ints.  extra and all the following arguments are
passed to the function after the element.
