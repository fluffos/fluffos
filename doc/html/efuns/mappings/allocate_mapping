allocate_mapping - pre-allocate space for a mapping

mapping allocate_mapping( int size );

Returns a mapping with space for 'size' elements preallocated.

For example:

<pre>
mapping x;
int y = 200;

x = allocate_mapping(y);
</pre>

where y is the initial size of the mapping.  Using allocate_mapping is
the preferred way to initalize the mapping if you have some idea of how
many elements the map will contain (200 in this case).  The reason is that
allocating storage all at once is slightly more efficient.  Thus if
you are using mappings to store a soul with 200 entries, the above
initialization would be quite appropriate.  Note, that the
above initialization does not restrict you to 200 entries.
