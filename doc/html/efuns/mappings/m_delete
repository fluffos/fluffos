m_delete - remove a key from a mapping

mapping m_delete(mapping m, mixed element);

This efun is only available if COMPAT_32 is defined.

It behaves exactly like map_delete(), except that it returns its first
argument.  

Note: the 3.2 version actually returns a copy of the mapping,
so for strict compatibility the following simul is suggested:

<pre>
mapping m_delete(mapping m, mixed element) 
{
    mapping ret = copy(m);
    map_delete(ret, element);
    return ret;
}
</pre>

However, this version is significantly faster as it avoids the copy.
