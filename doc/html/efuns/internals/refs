refs - return the number of references to a data structure

int refs( mixed data );

This efun is only available if PACKAGE_DEVELOP is compiled in.

The number of references to `data' will be returned by refs().  This is 
useful for deciding whether or not to make a copy of a data structure
before returning it.
