This efun is only available when PACKAGE_SOCKETS is compiled into the driver.
<p>
dump_socket_status() is a diagnostic facility which displays the current
status of all LPC sockets configured into the MudOS driver.  It is useful
for debugging LPC sockets applications.  Each row in the output corresponds
to a single LPC socket.  The first row corresponds to LPC socket descriptor 0,
the second row, 1, etc.  The total number of sockets is configured when the
driver is built.
<p>
The first column "Fd" is the operating system file descriptor associated
with the LPC socket.  "State" is the current operational state of the LPC
socket.  "Mode" is the socket mode, which is passed as an argument to
socket_create().  The local and remote addresses are the Internet address
and port numbers in Internet dot notations.  '*' indicates an address or
which is 0.  N.B. LPC sockets that are in the CLOSED state are not
currently in use; therefore the data displayed for that socket may be
idiosyncratic.
<p>
The following output was generated on Portals, where the only socket
application running at the time was MWHOD.  It indicates that two
sockets are current in use, one is listening for connection requests
on a STREAM mode socket.  The other is waiting for incoming data on
a DATAGRAM mode socket.
