traceprefix - sets the prefix determining which objects to trace

string traceprefix( string prefix );

This efun is only available if TRACE and PACKAGE_DEVELOP are compiled in.

If the the traceprefix is set (i.e. not 0) tracing will only occur in objects
having a name with the set prefix.

The old value is returned.
