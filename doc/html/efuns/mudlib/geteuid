geteuid - return the effective user id of an object or function

string geteuid( object|function );

This efun is only available if PACKAGE_UIDS is compiled into the driver.

If given an object argument, geteuid returns the effective user id (euid)
of the object.  If given an argument of type 'function', it returns the
euid of the object that created that 'function' variable.  If the object,
at the time of the function variable's construction, had no euid, the
object's uid is stored instead.
