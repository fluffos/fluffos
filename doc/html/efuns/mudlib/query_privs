query_privs - return the privs string for an object

string query_privs( object ob );

Returns the privs string for an object.  The privs string is determined
at compile time via a call to privs_file() in the master object, and changeable
via the set_privs() efun.

This efun is only available if PRIVS is defined at driver compile time.
