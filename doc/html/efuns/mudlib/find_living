find_living - find a living object matching a given id

object find_living( string str );

This efun is only available if NO_ADD_ACTION is not compiled in.

Find first the object that is marked as living, and answers to the
id 'str'.  A living object is an object that has called
enable_commands().  The object must have set a name with
set_living_name(), so its name will be entered into the hash table
used to speed up the search for living objects.
