environment - return the environment of an object

object environment( object ob );

This efun is only available if NO_ENVIRONMENT is not compiled in.

Return the containing object (environment) of 'ob'. If no argument
is given, 'ob' defaults to this_object().  If the object is not
inside anything, zero is returned.
