resolve - resolve an internet address to domain name

int resolve( string address, string callback_func );

resolve() resolves `address', which should be an internet address in the form
"127.0.0.1" or a domain name, into its domain name, or internet address.
When the resolve is complete, `callback_func' will be called in the
current object.  The form of the callback is:

void callback(string address, string resolved, int key);

`key' will match up with the number that the call to resolve() returned.
`address' will be the domain name of the host, and `resolved' the dotted
decimal ip address.  The unknown value will be 0 if the lookup failed.
