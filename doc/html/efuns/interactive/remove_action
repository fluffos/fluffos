remove_action - unbind a command verb from a local function

int remove_action( string fun, string cmd );

This efun is only available if NO_ADD_ACTION is not compiled in.

remove_action() unbinds a verb cmd from an object function fun. Basically,
remove_action() is the complement to add_action(). When a
verb is no longer required, it can be unbound with remove_action().

remove_action() returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
