<p>
<b> varargs void get_char( string | function fun, int flag, ... ); </b>
<p>
Enable next character of user input to be sent to the function `fun' as
an argument. The input character will not be parsed by the driver.
<p>
Note that get_char is non-blocking which means that the object calling
get_char does not pause waiting for input.  Instead the object continues
to execute any statements following the get_char.  The specified function
`fun' will not be called until the user input has been collected.
<p>
If "get_char()" is called more than once in the same execution, only the
first call has any effect.
<p>
If optional argument `flag' is non-zero, the char given by the player will
not be echoed, and is not seen if snooped (this is useful for collecting
passwords).
<p>
The function `fun' will be called with the user input as its first argument
(a string). Any additional arguments supplied to get_char will be passed on to
`fun' as arguments following the user input.
