<p>
Return the object representing the user that caused the calling function
to be called.  Note that this_user() may return a different value than
this_object() even when called from within a user object.  If this_user
is called as this_user(1) then the returned value will be the interactive
that caused the calling function to be called.  this_user(1) may return
a different value than this_user() in certain cases (such as when command()
is used by an admin to force a user to perform some command).
