say - send a message to all users in the same environment

varargs void say( string str, object | object array );

Sends a message to the environment of the originator, all items in the
same environment, and all items inside of the originator.  The originator
is this_player(), unless this_player() == 0, in which case, the originator
is this_object().

The second argument is optional.  If second argument `obj' is specified,
the message is sent to all except `obj'.  If `obj' is not an object, but
an array of objects, all those objects are excluded from receiving the
message.
