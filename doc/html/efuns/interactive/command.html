<b> int command( string str ); </b>

This efun is only available if NO_ADD_ACTION isn't defined.
<p>
Execute 'str' for the object this_object() as a command (matching against
add_actions and such).  The object must have called enable_commands() for
this to have any effect.
In case of failure, 0 is returned, otherwise a numeric value is returned,
which is the LPC "evaluation cost" of the command.  Bigger numbers mean
higher cost, but the whole scale is subjective and unreliable.
