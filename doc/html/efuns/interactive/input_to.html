<p>
<b> varargs void input_to( string | function fun, int flag, ... ); </b>
<p>
Enable next line of user input to be sent to the local function 'fun' as
an argument. The input line will not be parsed by the driver.
<p>
Note that input_to is non-blocking which means that the object calling
input_to does not pause waiting for input.  Instead the object continues
to execute any statements following the input_to.  The specified function
'fun' will not be called until the user input has been collected.
<p>
If "input_to()" is called more than once in the same execution, only the
first call has any effect.
<p>
If optional argument 'flag' has the 1 bit set, the line given by the player
will not be echoed, and is not seen if snooped (this is useful for collecting
passwords).
<p>
If 'flag' has the 2 bit set, the input_to cannot be bypassed by beginning the
command with '!'.  Otherwise, lines which start with '!' drop through to
the normal input handler.
<p>
The function 'fun' will be called with the user input as its first argument
(a string). Any additional arguments supplied to input_to will be passed on to
'fun' as arguments following the user input.
