ed_start - start up 'ed'

This efun is only available if OLD_ED is not defined.

string ed_start(string file, int flag);

string ed_start(string file);

string ed_start();

If 'flag' is nonzero, ed is started in restricted mode.  See the documentation
for the old efun for information.  'file' is the name of the file to open;
if none is given then no file becomes active.

ed_start() may not be called when another ed session for the current
object is already active.  Any messages generated while starting up ed
are returned by this efun.
