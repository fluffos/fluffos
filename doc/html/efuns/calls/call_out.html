<p>
<b> int call_out( function fun, int delay, mixed arg, ... ); </b>
<p>
Set up a call to 'fun'.  If fun is a string, it is interpreted as the
name of a function in this_object().  The call will take place 'delay'
seconds later, with the arguments 'arg' and following provided.
<p>
Note:
Unless THIS_PLAYER_IN_CALL_OUT is defined, you can't rely on
write() or say() in 'fun' since this_player() is set to 0.
Use tell_object() instead.
<p>
If THIS_PLAYER_IN_CALL_OUT is defined, this_player() is the same as
it was when the call_out() call was scheduled.
<p>
The return value will be a unique integer identifying the call_out, if
CALLOUT_HANDLES is defined.  This 'handle' can be passed to
remove_call_out() and find_call_out().
