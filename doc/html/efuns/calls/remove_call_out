remove_call_out - remove a pending call_out

int remove_call_out( string fun | int handle );

Remove next pending call out for function `fun' in the current object,
or the call_out() which returned the integer 'handle'.
The return value is the time remaining before the callback is to be called.
The returned value is -1 if there were no call out pending to this function.
If fun is zero, all the call_outs of the object are removed.
