ref

The 'ref' keyword introduces the ability to use pass-by-reference when
calling functions, as opposed to pass-by-value.  Consider the following
routine:

PRE
void f(int x) {
    x++;
}

void create() {
    int x = 5;
    printf("%i\n", x);
    f(x);
    printf("%i\n", x);
}
ENDPRE

The output will be 5 in both cases, since only the value of x (5) is
passed to f; when f modifies x it only modifies its own copy, not the
copy in create().  However, if we instead write:

PRE
void f(int ref x) {
    x++;
}

void create() {
    int x = 5;
    printf("%i\n", x);
    f(ref x);
    printf("%i\n", x);
}
ENDPRE

the output will be 5 and then 6.  In the declaration of f, 'int ref x'
indicates that the actual variable 'x' should be used and modified,
not just its value.  Note that 'ref' also must be used when calling f;
this is so that it is obvious when reading create that the call to
f() might modify x.

Anything which can appear on the left side of '=' (i.e. anything that
can be modified) can be passed by reference, with one exception:
'x[1..2] = ({ 1 })' is legal, but 'ref x[1..2]' is not.  'ref x[4]'
is perfectly legal, however.
