<p>
If RECEIVE_SNOOP is defined in options.h or <A HREF=http://www.imaginary.com/~beek/mudos/options/local_options.html>  local_options </A>,
whenever a user is snooping another
user, all snoop text is sent to receive_snoop() in their user object.  Inside
of this function, you can do as you wish with the text.  A common activity
would be to receive() it.
