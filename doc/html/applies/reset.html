<b> void reset(); </b>
<p>
After every reset interval (whose exact length is determined on
a mud by mud basis, but averages around every 2 hours), reset()
is called in every object that currently exists.  If LAZY_RESETS
is defined in options.h in the driver, reset() will only be called
in objects when they are touched (near players), so unused objects
will not be loaded from the swap file to reset.
