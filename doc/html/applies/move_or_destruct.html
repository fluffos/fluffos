<b> int move_or_destruct( object dest ); </b>
<p>
If an object's environment is destructed, this apply is called on it's
contents.  'dest' will be the environment of the destructing object,
or zero if it has none.  If the object does not move itself out of
the object being destructed, it will be destructed as well.
