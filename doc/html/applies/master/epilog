epilog - handle initialization

string array epilog( int load_empty ); 

The driver calls epilog() in master after the master object has been loaded.
Required initialization may be done at this point.  If epilog() returns an
array of filenames, the driver will attempt to load those files via the
preload() function.

The variable 'load_empty' is non-zero if the -e option was specified
when starting up the driver, which has been historically used to mean
no preloads, although the mudlib is free to use another interpretation.
