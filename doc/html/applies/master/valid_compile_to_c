valid_compile_to_c - determine whether LPC->C compilation may take place

int valid_compile_to_c(); 

valid_compile_to_c() is called when the generate_source() efun is used to
generate C files or to do runtime compilation of an object.  One might
want to restrict the use of this since the process can be CPU intensive.
