get_save_file_name - back up editor file on abnormal exit

string get_save_file_name( string file, object who );

This master apply is called by ed() when a player disconnects
while in the editor and editing a file.  This function
should return an alternate file name for the file to
be saved, to avoid overwriting the original.

Note: This apply used to be named get_ed_buffer_save_file_name().
