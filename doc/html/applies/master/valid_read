valid_read - checks if a certain person has read permission on a file

int valid_read( string file, object user, string func );

Every time an object tries to read a file, the driver calls valid_read
in the master object to check if the read should be allowed.  The
arguments are the filename, the object making the read, and
the calling function name.  If valid_read returns non-zero, the read is
allowed.
