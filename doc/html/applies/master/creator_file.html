<b> string creator_file(string filename); </b>
<p>
This routine is only used if PACKAGE_UIDS is used.
<p>
The creator_file() function is called in the master object each time a new
object is created.  The `filename' of the object is passed as the sole
parameter, and the string that creator_file() returns is set as the new
object's uid.  If the AUTO_SETEUID option is enabled at compile-time of the
driver, it is also set as the new object's euid.
.PP
One exception: if the AUTO_TRUST_BACKBONE option is enabled at compile-time of
the driver, and creator_file() returns the backbone uid (as specified by
get_bb_uid() in the master object), the object is given the uid and euid of
the object that loaded it.
