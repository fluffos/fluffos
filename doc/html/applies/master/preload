preload - preload an object into memory

void preload( string filename );

For each string in the array returned by epilog, the driver calls 
preload(filename).  Note that there is the equivalent of a catch() around
these calls at the driver level, so it is not neccessary for the mudlib
to worry about the sequence being terminated by an error.

Typical behavoir is to use load_object() to attempt to load the file.
