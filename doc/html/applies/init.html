<b> void init(); </b>
<p>
This function is not called if NO_ADD_ACTIONS is defined.
<p>
When the mudlib moves an object "A" inside another object "B", the
driver (the move_object() efunction) does the following:
<p>
<DL>
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> if "A" is living, causes "A" to call the init() in "B"
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> causes each living object in the inventory of "B" to call init() in
"A".  regardless of whether "A" is living or not.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> if "A" is living, causes "A" to call the init() in each object in
the inventory of "B".
</DL>
<p>
Note: an object is considered to be living if enable_commands() has
been called by that object.
<p>
Typically, the init() function in an object is used to call add_action()
for each command that the object offers.
