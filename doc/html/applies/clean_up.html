<b> int clean_up( int inherited );  </b>
<p>
The clean_up() function is called by the driver on a regular basis in all
objects that have been inactive for the time specified for clean_up() in the
runtime configuration file.  One flag is passed to the function, specifying
whether or not the object has been inheritted by anything.  If clean_up()
returns 0, clean_up() will never be called again on that object.  If it returns
1, it will be called again when the object remains inactive for the specified
clean_up() delay.
<p>
One thing that might be commonly done by an object in this function is
destructing itself to conserve memory.  However, one often does not want
to destruct objects which have been inherited, as this will cause a new
copy to be loaded next time they are inherited again, causing more than
one copy of the code to be in memory.
