OOP stands for "Object-Oriented Programming"
<p>
If you know how to code in C or Pascal or even one of the modern BASICs
(with procedures), then you already have many of the skills you will need
to program effectively in LPC.  The main thing you need is a skill in
translating your ideas into a sequential flow of steps (that a computer
can perform).  However, LPC is also an object-oriented language.
To effectively use LPC, you would benefit from a knowledge of OOP principles
and concepts.  Following are some of the principles of object-oriented
programming (note that LPC doesn't necessarily provide mechanisms
supporting all of these principles):
<p>
<DL>
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> systems are modularized on the basis of their data structures.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> objects should be described as implementations of abstract data types.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> unused objects should be deallocated by the underlying language system,
without programmer intervention.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> every non-simple type is a module, and every high-level module is a type.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> a class may be defined as an extension or restriction of another.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> program entities should be allowed to refer to objects of more than
one class, and operations should be permitted to have different realizations
in different classes.
<DT> <IMG SRC = http://www.imaginary.com/Graphics/Whiteball.gif> it should be possible to declare a class as heir to more than one class,
and more than once to the same class.

[These seven principles were taken from the "Object-oriented Software
Construction" book by Bertrand Meyer]
