See the changelogs on the Web pages for more complete info (and info after
0.9.19)
<p>
0.9.18 to 0.9.19
<p>
. COMPAT BUSTER: array = array + scalar is no longer allowed
  (array += scalar was already not allowed)
<p>
. COMPAT BUSTER: socket_accept() no longer assumes the newly created socket
  is immediately writable; this may cause slightly different behavior (such
  as the return of EECALLBACK on the first socket_write() whereas it never
  happened before, or write_callbacks being called that never got called
  before)
<p>
. COMPAT BUSTER: socket callbacks (including the resolve() callback) can
  now be static and will still be callable by the driver.  this can cause
  different previous_object() behavior, causing some old socket callback
  security checks to behave improperly
<p>
. COMPAT BUSTER: fixed explode() so that explode("", "\n") does not return
  ({ 0 })...and removed support for a string as first argument of
  move_object().
<p>
. COMPAT BUSTER: removed the following efuns: cat(), log_file(), extract(),
  shadowp(), next_living(), add_worth(), add_verb(), and add_xverb()
<p>
. COMPAT BUSTER: removed the 'cost' and 'worth' fields from 
  domain/author_stats
<p>
. functionp() now returns 2 instead of 1 in the case where 
  f = (: obj, ({ str, arg0, arg1, arg2, ... }) :).  (ie, the function portion 
  is an array)
<p>
. geteuid() may now be used on type 'function'.  geteuid(f) where f is of
  type function will return the euid of the constructor of 'f'.  if the
  constructor didn't have an euid at the time of f's creation, its uid
  is stored instead
<p>
. ed's indentor ('I' command) fixed
<p>
. fixed the usage of '!' in get_char() mode
<p>
. fixed several Linux crash/hang bugs
<p>
. mud_status() improved, total now matches up with the sum of the fields
<p>
. revised parse_command() and process_string() efuns, added process_value()
  and break_string() efuns (see docs for information)
<p>
. added a new LPC type called 'buffer' that is a cross between the
  LPC array type and the LPC string type.  'buffer' is intended as a way to 
  conveniently manipulate binary data.  'buffer' is not zero-terminated 
  (that is, it has an associated length).  A 'buffer' is an array of bytes 
  that is implemented using one byte per element.  buf[i] = x and x = buf[i] 
  are allowed and do work.  sizeof(buf) works.  bufferp(buf) is available.  
  buf[i..j] should work as well.  buff = read_buffer(file_name, ...) 
  (same args as read_bytes).  also 'int write_buffer(string file, int start, 
  mixed source)', buf = buf1 + buf2; buf += buf1, buf = allocate_buffer(size).
  The socket efuns have been modified to accept and return the 'buffer' type.  
  Two new socket modes are available:  STREAM_BINARY (3), and 
  DATAGRAM_BINARY (4).  the runtime config file now needs a 'maximum buffer
  size' parameter in it which sets the largest 'buffer' that may be created.
<p>
. now possible to use write_bytes() to write past the end of the existing file
<p>
. read_bytes(filename) will now read the entire file (instead of requiring 
  read_bytes(filename, 0, length_of_file)).
<p>
. added an 'int crc32(buffer b|string s) efun which computes a 32-bit
  cyclic redundancy code for a given buffer or string.  This is the same 
  algorithm (and code) that Zmodem uses for doing its CRC calculations.
<p>
. overloaded to_int() to accept 'buffer'.  E.g. buffer b; int x;
  b = read_buffer(file, 0, 4); x = to_int(b);  Note that to_int() expects 
  the integer embedded in the buffer to be in network-byte-order.
<p>
. In addition to 'int write_buffer(string file, int start, mixed source)'
  there is also 'int write_buffer(buffer target, int start, mixed source)'
  Note that write_buffer(string file, int start, int x) will write 'x'
  into the file (or buffer) in network-byte-order.
<p>
. In addition to 'buffer read_buffer(string file, int start, int len)'
  there is also 'string read_buffer(buffer b, int start, int len)' which
  provides a way to extract part or all of a buffer into a string.
<p>
. added two malloc debugging efuns that provide an interface to the malloc 
  debugging system calls provided by the NeXTSTEP OS (malloc_debug() and 
  malloc_check()).  See NEXT_MALLOC_DEBUG in options.h for more info.  
  These efuns aren't available on other OSes.
<p>
. (: "string" :) is now equivalent to (: this_object(), "string" :)
<p>
. added replace_program() efun, modified from Amylaar's 3.2.  
<p>
. added optional argument to query_heart_beat(), object to query the 
  heart_beat of 
<p>
. changed set_eval_limit() so an argument of 0 resets the current eval_cost, 
  rather than setting the eval limit to 0
<p>
. added support to initialize local variables.  Any valid expression
  allowed (int x = <exp>;), as with global initializations 
<p>
. removed several no-longer-used options from options.h (some of the more
  notable ones include support for driver-level host access restrictions
  and shout logging)
<p>
. changed more efuns so that removing their line in func_spec.c causes most, 
  if not all, of their code to not be compiled in to the driver
<p>
. removed the following items from the driver config file: "access log file",
  "access allow file", "config directory", "allowed ed cmds" (an up-to-date
  Config.example is in the src/ dir)
<p>
. the simul_efun object can now be updated and new simul_efuns will go into
  place without having to reboot the driver
<p>
. hundreds of minor bug fixes and optimizations; see src/ChangeLog for a full
  list
<p>
0.9.17 to 0.9.18
<p>
. COMPAT BUSTER: preprocessor: MUDOS_PORT changed to __PORT__, MUDOS_ARCH
  changed to __ARCH__, MUDOS_VERSION to "2.7.2".  Added __COMPILER__,
  __COMPILER_VERSION__, and __OPTIMIZATION__ defines.  Removed the NO_SHADOWS
  define, and added the following possible defines: HAS_SOCKETS, 
  HAS_SHADOWS, HAS_DEBUGMALLOC, HAS_MATH, HAS_MATRIX, HAS_ED, HAS_PRINTF,
  HAS_PRIVS, HAS_EACH, HAS_CACHE_STATS, HAS_RUSAGE, HAS_DEBUG_LEVEL, 
  HAS_OPCPROF.
<p>
. COMPAT BUSTER: rusage() efun: renamed the "usertime" field to "utime"
  for consistency, and changed it so that the utime and stime fields are 
  always returned in units of milliseconds.
<p>
. COMPAT BUSTER: removed uid checks from add_worth() efun: if you don't
  want people calling this function, you will need a simul_efun override.
<p>
. call_other() on an array of objects now returns an array of the return
  values.
<p>
. Changed printf() to be caught by catch_tell() (if defined in options.h)
<p>
. Changed notify_fail() to always return 0, allowing for simpler code,
  ie: return notify_fail("Read what?\n");, etc
<p>
. (s)printf()/sscanf() improvements/fixes.
<p>
. New efuns: match_path(), query_heart_beat(), origin(), function_profile(),
  strsrch(), errorp().
<p>
. Added the capability of saving loaded LPC programs to disk (.b files) so
  subsequent loading is faster (added new "save binaries directory" line in
  the runtime configuration file).
<p>
. Changed dump_prog() to take an optional third argument: the file to
  dump to.
<p>
. Disk swapping improved: line number info is swapped out, and swapfile
  space is reused.
<p>
. Added #elif (else if) to the preprocessor.
<p>
. LOG_CATCHES option added to options.h; if defined, errors caught by
  catch() will still be logged to debug.log, prefixed by "caught: ".
<p>
. Incorporated Wildcard@TMI-2's (John Fehr: umfehr06@ccu.umanitoba.ca)
  port of MudOS to the Amiga (running AmigaDOS).  The port was made using the
  LATTICE C Compiler.  For those Amiga owners without the LATTICE C compiler 
  (or the desire to compile the driver from the source), the Amiga MudOS 
  binaries are available from actlab.rtf.utexas.edu in 
  /MUD/LPmud/MudOS/amiga.  This port of MudOS does not fully support the 
  socket efunctions.  Any Amiga guru wanting to make them work please feel 
  free (and send your patches to mudos-bugs@actlab.rtf.utexas.edu!).
<p>
. Added @@ENDMARKER processing, which works similarly to @ENDMARKER, but
  produces an array of strings (1 string per line in the block).  
<p>
. New second argument to each() efun that resets the current position in the
  mapping kept track of by each().  each(map, 1) will reset the position.
<p>
. Changed objects() to take two optional parameters: objects(func, ob)
  will pass each object as an argument to ob->func(), and will only return
  the ones for which that function returns 1.
<p>
. Literally hundreds of bug fixes and optimizations--for full details,
  read the ChangeLog in the ./src directory.
<p>
0.9.16 to 0.9.17
<p>
. MudOS now compiles and runs on the DEC Alpha running OSF/1
<p>
. prelang.y and postlang.y combined into compiler.y - the changes in this
  area should allow the .y files to compile with many more yacc's than
  before (Ultrix, Sun?)
<p>
. addr_server made more robust and compilable on more machines
<p>
. Added an OLD_ULTRIX define in port.h for some VAXes running old versions
  of Ultrix; should allow the driver to compile/run on them
<p>
. Anytime an object is compiled now, valid_object(ob) is called in master.
  If valid_object _exists_, and returns 0, then ob is destructed before
  create() is called and the efun that caused the load errors.  (usage
  of this, along with inherits() and 'nomask', could allow usage of things 
  such as destruct() to be safely restricted through simul_efuns and
  valid_override() in master)
<p>
. Basic optimization of numeric constants in LPC code is now done (if
  LPC_OPTIMIZE is defined in options.h)
<p>
. call_other() can now take an array as a second argument, where the first 
  item of the array is the function to call, and all following items will be 
  passed as arguments in the order which they occur
<p>
. Added an LPC object disassembler (dump_prog() efun)
<p>
. New resolve() efun which can translate ip names to numbers and vice-versa
  (see efun docs)
<p>
. Snoops will be sent to receive_snoop(msg) in the receiver object now if
  RECEIVE_SNOOP is defined in options.h
<p>
. Extension to set_heart_beat(x), where if x > 1, x is used as the number
  of heart beats inbetween heart_beat() calls (can be disabled in options.h)
<p>
. Extension (3rd argument) to member_array(), which, if set to 1 and using
  a string as 1st arg, checks only the prefix of the strings in the array 
  (similar to xverbs vs verbs)
<p>
. Added a new efun inherits(string filename, object base) which returns 1
  if base inherits the latest copy of filename, 2 if it inherits an old copy,
  and 0 if it does not inherit filename.  This efun avoids the cost of
  creating an array via deep_inherit()
<p>
. Added OLD_COMMAND to options.h - if defined, the old second argument to 
  command() will again be available
<p>
. Added query_shadowing(), a preferred synonym for the shadowp() efun
<p>
. replace_string() efun expanded to support an optional 4th and 5th 
  argument (see efun docs)
<p>
. Added query_snooping() efun (inverse of query_snoop()) - might want to
  add a simul_efun override for this
<p>
. Added query_privs(), set_privs() efuns and privs_file() apply in master 
  if PRIVS is defined in options.h - read the comments there for information
<p>
. Added a new "function" called time_expression() that returns the number
  of microseconds realtime that occurred during execution of the expression
  passed to it
<p>
. Added rusage() support for HP-UX 8.x/9.x (if using 7.x, define OLD_HPUX
  in port.h) and SunOS 5
<p>
. The writing of text (prefixed with ']') to stderr is no longer done by
  default; can be enabled in options.h (NONINTERACTIVE_STDERR_WRITE)
<p>
. save_object() now inserts a "#filename" at the top of savefiles 
  (restore_object() ignores such lines; this is useful for virtual object
  compilers that want to figure out how to compile .o files)
<p>
. functionp(funp) now returns 0 if funp[0] is a destructed object
<p>
. Driver now calls crash() in master.c with "Host machine shutting down"
  when SIGUSR1 is received
<p>
. Caught errors (via catch()) are now written to debug.log, prefixed with
  "caught:"
<p>
. object::func_name() is now allowed (previously, the existence of the 
  'object' type caused conflicts when trying to use object::)
<p>
. Compat buster: Fixed a bug in multiple inheritance semantics.
   object a: bingme() { bing(); } bing() { write("bingAAA\n"); }
   object b: bingme() { bing(); } bing() { write("bingBBB\n"); }
   object c: inherit a; inherit b;
             bing() { write("bingCCC\n"); }
             create() { a::bingme(); b::bingme() }
  The old behavior would have been to write bingCCC then bingAAA.
  The new behavior is to write bingCCC then bingCCC.
<p>
. Compat buster: removed arch(), version(), and mud_name() functions.  Added
  MUDOS_ARCH, MUDOS_VERSION, and MUD_NAME defines that are exported to all
  LPC objects - also, the DIR define was changed to MUDOS_DIR
<p>
. Plenty of bug fixes and optimizations
<p>
0.9.15 to 0.9.16                                   
<p>
. Brought the documentation up-to-date.
<p>
. Added support for a new basic type: 'float'.  32 bit floating point
  (decimal) numbers, and some basic efuns to deal with them: to_float(),
  to_int(), and floatp().
<p>
. Added some math efuns for use with floats: cos(), sin(), tan(), asin(),
  acos(), atan(), sqrt(), log(), pow(), exp(), floor(), ceil().  Can be 
  removed by undef'ing MATH in options.h.
<p>
. Added some efuns for 3D graphics: id_matrix(), translate(), scale(), 
  rotate_x(), rotate_y(), rotate_z(), lookat_rotate(), lookat_rotate2().  Can
  be removed by undef'ing MATRIX in options.h.
<p>
. New efuns: shadowp(), set_reset(), reclaim_objects(), objects(), 
  memory_info(), reload_object()
<p>
. Old efun, back again: virtualp()
<p>
. COMPAT BUSTER: query_snoop() can now be called from anywhere, so you might
  want to put in a simul_efun override for it.
<p>
. Added a port for HP Motorola (680x0) systems running BSD 4.3.
<p>
. Added a port for SPARC Classic running Solaris (SunOS 5.1).
<p>
. Partial ports for Cray (UNICOS 6.1.7) and DEC Alpha (OSF/1 1.2).  Neither 
  is complete as of yet.
<p>
. Added support for type 'function' in (s)printf()'s %O format spec
<p>
. SAVE_EXTENSION define is now imported to all LPC code (ie ".o")
<p>
. Modified save_object() so the original save file is not lost if the save 
  fails due to disk full, quota exceeded, etc.
<p>
. Added support for comments in object save files (ie .o files).
<p>
. #ifdef'ed all of the efuns so removing an efun def from func_spec.c
  automagically removes some of the associated code for it.
<p>
. Continued optimizing many things.
<p>
. Many more bug fixes (see src/ChangeLog for full information).
<p>
0.9.14 to 0.9.15
<p>
. added a new feature similar to the << EOF text reading feature
  provided by Perl.  The @ character now means interpret from 'here'
  til the end of the line as the "terminator".  Lex then considers each
  following line up to the terminator as forming part of a string literal.
  An example usage is as follows:
<p>
  x = @END
  This is taken literally.
  And so is this.
  END
  ;
<p>
. optimized the code produced by the LPC loop control constructs (for and
  while). These optimizations are modeled after those appearing
  in Amylaar's enhanced LPmud driver.  MudOS 'for loops' now contain three
  fewer instructions per loop (the empty loop goes from 9 to 6 instructions
  The execution speed of the MudOS empty for loop (not that this is
  that meaningful :) is now within 1% of the speed of the empty for loop
  in Amylaar's driver.
<p>
. optimized a few of the LPC operators to produce smaller code.
<p>
. added the moncontrol() efun which lets profiling (of the driver - an
  in gmon.out and gprof) be turned on and off from inside the mudlib.
<p>
. added support for several new platforms (machines and operating systems)
  including SGI, Linux, 386bsd, A/UX (Apple UNIX(tm)), and HP Apollo.
<p>
. fixed the general compile time switch case problem
<p>
. added an error() efun which is like a throw() that doesn't require a catch.
<p>
. incorporated Amylaar's latest enhanced version of smalloc (uses fast fit).
<p>
. added option to options.h to allow save files to have an extension other
  than .o (for those having sysadmins who run scripts that remove .o files
  on a periodic basis).
<p>
. changed save_object() and restore_object() so that variables with a value
  of zero (0) needn't be saved to the .o file (however, the old behavior
  is still available for those who want it).  This can produce a noticeable
  savings in disk space.
<p>
0.9.0 to 0.9.14
<p>
. added a new data type named 'function'.  Be sure to change the names of
  any variables you may have named 'function'.  This data type is a variant
  on the idea of function pointers.  It may be used to store an
  (object, function) pair in a single variable.  The constructor for function
  variables is as follows: 
<p>
  function f;
<p>
  f = (: obj, func :);
<p>
  where obj and func may be anything allowed by call_other(obj, func).
  To call the function func in object obj via function variable f, type:
<p>
  (*f)(arg0, arg1, ...); 
<p>
  You may use the new functionp() efun to detect if a variable is of type
  function.
<p>
. the driver now compiles under the xlc compiler on the RS/6000 (xlc is IBM's
  fastest of AIX 3.2 C compilers).
<p>
. added Mappings and Interactives fields to the stats output by mud_status().
<p>
. added a new efun set_eval_limit (#define SET_EVAL_LIMIT on options.h) that
  allows an object to change the max eval cost limit.  Be sure to add
  appropriate mudlib level security before enabling this efun (read the
  ChangeLog 0.9.13.4).
<p>
. added Cynosure's livings() efun that returns an array of all objects that
  have called enable_commands() (and haven't yet called disable_commands()).
<p>
. changed the behavior of nullp() and undefinedp() slightly (see 0.9.13.2
  ChangeLog).
<p>
. The catch() efun may no longer be used to trap max eval_cost exceeded
  errors (and thus hang the driver).
<p>
. System V Release 4 support (added M.B. Bundy's patches)
<p>
. Ridge (RISC/os) support added.
<p>
. added capability to configure the default 'What?' message via the runtime
  config file.
<p>
. dramatically improved global apply_low (call_other) cache hit rates.  Many
  muds that used to have hit rates near 40% are reporting 93% and above.
  [This improvement results from fixing a bug we found in the LPmud 3.1.2
   cache code.  See ChangeLog for more details.]
<p>
. 0.9.14 mappings use about 50% less memory overhead per mapping (compared
  to 0.9.0).
<p>
. improved performance.  MudOS 0.9.14 is much faster than MudOS 0.9.0
  at executing many of the more commonly used eoperators.
<p>
. created an efuns.h file that should be #include'd from any file that wants
  to define new efunctions (see efunctions.c for example).
<p>
. added strcmp() efun (just like C's strcmp) that is convenient for use in
  the compare functions used by sort_array().  sort_array() has been recoded
  to use a robust version of qsort so that ill-behaved compare functions won't
  crash the driver.
<p>
. added efuns clonedp() (detects if an object was created via clone_object),
  functionp() (detects if a variable is of type 'function').
<p>
. added a new eoperator F_CALL_EXTRA that allows for 512 efuns+eopers instead
  of the previous limit of 256 (easily extended to allow more).  This replaces
  and enhances the F_CALL_EFUN that we had added to the previous release.
<p>
0.8.1 to 0.9.0
<p>
. Literally hundreds of bug fixes (read the ChangeLog file in the source
  directory for complete descriptions of these if you're interested)
<p>
. MudOS now runs on more architectures.  See the Platforms file.
<p>
. (internal change) totally rewrote and replaced communication code in the
  driver (comm.c) to be more efficient.
<p>
. added socket efunctions for inter-object and inter-mud communication
  (see separate socket efun tutorial and man pages for more a detailed
  explanation)
        * int socket_create(int, string, string|void);
        * int socket_bind(int, int);
        * int socket_listen(int, string);
        * int socket_accept(int, string, string);
        * int socket_connect(int, string, string, string);
        * int socket_write(int, mixed, string|void);
        * int socket_close(int);
        * int socket_release(int, object, string);
        * int socket_acquire(int, string, string, string);
        * string socket_error(int);
        * string socket_address(int);
        * void dump_socket_status(void);
        * void dump_file_descriptors();
<p>
. added MUD mode to the LPC socket efunctions.  MUD mode allows LPC
  data structures such as arrays, mappings, integers, and strings (all
  except for objects) to be sent atomically via sockets.
<p>
. added DATAGRAM (UDP) mode to the LPC socket efunctions.
<p>
. (internal change) rearchitected interpret.c to use a function lookup table
  rather than one large switch statement.  New efunctions should be added
  to efunctions.c instead of interpret.c.  This enhancement makes it
  easier to integrate your own efuns into the driver and it allows interpret.c
  to compile on machines that previously had problems with it.
<p>
. added call to master.c::valid_override(string filename, string function)
  for each attempt to override a simulated efunction via the
  efun::func_name() method.  'filename' is the path to the file which
  is attempting to call efun::func_name().  'function' is the name of
  the efun that is to be overridden.  If valid_override returns 0, then
  the current compilation will fail (note: valid_override is only called
  at compile time and _not_ runtime).  valid_override allows
  valid_destruct, valid_exec, etc. to be dispensed with since the same
  functionality can be obtained by wrapping the efun in question with a
  simul_efun of the same name (and including valid_* style checking in the
  simul_efun).  Gist of the idea taken from Amylaar's done file.
<p>
. added the option of configuring the driver so that resets (the calling of
  reset() in LPC objects) happen in a lazy fashion (by defining LAZY_RESETS
  in options.h).  This option allows resets to happen in an incrementally
  (rather than all in one pass) and it prevents resets from occuring unless
  the object to be reset is touched (via an apply_low or move_object) after
  the usual required reset delay has occurred.  The benefits of this option
  are that performance is smoother (no reset lags) and memory is conserved
  (since those object which are touched once and never again won't have reset
  called in them and hence won't reload any objects in reset()).
<p>
. changed various efunctions to honor the hidden object flags so that
  the set_hide() efunction now offers true driver-supported invisibility
  of objects.
<p>
. new internal implementation of mappings (associative arrays) which is
  faster and more robust.
<p>
. new efuns for mappings:
        * keys() - this used to be named indices()
        * values() - the inverse of keys()
        * each() - traverse a mapping
<p>
. split config.h into options.h and port.h.  This simplifies the task
  of configuring the driver to run on a particular machine.  In most
  cases, it will be sufficient to configure options.h (options.h contains
  configuration options pertaining to preference rather than portability).
<p>
. fixed make_func.y so that it correctly processes func_spec.c on the
  HP and Sequent.
<p>
. added a NO_ANSI option to options.h that allows escape codes included
  in user commands to be replaced with spaces.
<p>
. added a MAX_SAVE_SVALUE_DEPTH macro to options.h which solves the problem
  of calling save_object on an object containing a data structure with
  a circular (recursive) reference.  Admittedly, this isn't a true fix since
  the object in question (having the circular reference) cannot be saved;
  however, this is better than allowing the driver to hang.  (Yes I know
  that Amylaar solved this by saving the circular reference in a recoverable
  fashion.  I didn't consider it an important enough problem to spend the
  time necessary to adopt his solution).
<p>
. added a new efunction replace_string() (see the replace_string man page)
<p>
. added a clonep() efunction that determines if an object was created
  via the clone_object() efunction.
<p>
. added a localtime() efunction (see the localtime(3) man page)
<p>
. added an uptime() efunction that returns the number of seconds since
  the driver has been running.
<p>
. removed the mudwho code from the driver (including clilib.c).  We have
  implemented the mudwho protocol (same as that implemented in clilib.c)
  in LPC using the new MudOS socket efunctions (DATAGRAM mode).  See the
  README in the included mini-mudlib for more details.
<p>
. changed inherit_list() and deep_inherit_list() not to return the filename
  which is passed to them.
<p>
. added a configuration option that causes this_player() to return 0 inside
  callbacks made by call_out().
<p>
. heartbeat interval can be now be specified in units of microseconds on
  those machines with the ualarm() system call.
<p>
. size of the call_other cache table is configurable (via the
  APPLY_CACHE_BITS define in options.h).* (internal change)
  totally rewrote and replaced communication code in the driver (comm.c) to
  be more efficient.
<p>
. made the ed() efunction (internal editor) optional.
<p>
. input_to can now take extra arguments so that you can pass one or more
  extra arguments to the function input_to calls (notice
  that this feature makes it possible to avoid using global variables which
  makes it easier for a single object to be designed to
  beshared by many players [e.g. daemon-style objects]).  For example:
<p>
        void get_name(string name, object new_player)
        {
                write("\nWhat is your email address: ");
                input_to("get_email", 0, new_player, name);
        }
        void get_email(string email, object new_player, string name)
        {
                new_player->set_email(email);
                new_player->set_name(name);
        }
<p>
. implemented variable arguments to call_out just like the additions made to
  input_to described above.
<p>
. You can now compare mappings for equality using the == operator.
<p>
. the message() efun now works. For more info read the accompanying doc on
  this important new efun!
<p>
. several new required functions to be implemented in the mudlib master.c:
        * valid_socket - security to monitor or limit usage of the new socket efuns
        * valid_domain - a check for domain_stats to make sure that it only keeps
          stats on domains that you care about
        * valid_hide - for the set_hide() efun so that who can be "hidden" is
          controlled by master.c
        * slow_shutdown - when the driver is running out of memory and wants a
          nice shutdown it calls this
<p>
. several new additions to the runtime configuration file:
        * inherit chain size : the maximum inheritance depth allowed.  This is
          mainly to prevent infinite inheritance loops
        * maximum mapping size : similar to maximum array size
        * address server ip : machine name where an addr_server is running
        * address server port : port number that the addr_server is listening on
        * max users : this used to be max players (doesn't matter anyway, since
          this is still unused by the driver here)
        * maximum efun sockets : control the number of efun sockets open at once
        * maximum string length: controls the maximum allowed string size
<p>
. wizlist() changed to domain_stats(), this is to make statistic taking more
  consistant with the new domain model versus the wizard model previous
  to LPmud 3.0.  See also: author_stats()
<p>
. valid clone - this isn't enabled by default, but with some changes to
  options.h, clone_object will fail if an object doesn't have read permission
  on the file being cloned. (note: this is pretty useless since inheritance
  doesn't have a similar check)
<p>
. old "parser magic functions" were changed into efuns:
        * malloc_status() - was the 'malloc' command
        * dumpallobj() - was the command of the same name
        * mud_status() - was 'status' (use mud_status(1) to get 'status tables'
<p>
. some new debugging efuns were added or changed:
        * rusage() now returns a mapping of the values returned by the
          getrusage() system call.
        * debugmalloc() - if the driver is compiled with malloc debugging enabled
          this prints out more detailed malloc information
        * set_malloc_mask()  - control the level of info being debugged with
          debugmalloc
        * set_debug_level() - more control on debugging levels (see debug.h in
          the src directory)
        * opcprof() - dump a file detailing efun usage (usage frequencies)
        * cache_stats() - display call_other function table cache hit rate
          information
<p>
. removed the old hname process and replaced it with a new autonomous (not
  forked from driver) addr_server program that can be shared by several
  different drivers at once.
<p>
. removed the cindent() efun
<p>
. removed the describe() efun
<p>
. removed two unused variables from the runtime config system
        * global include file
        * max commands per heartbeat
<p>
. removed everything to do with the "priveleged object" concept
        * set_priv()
        * privp()
<p>
. removed everything to do with "global verbs", "global preverbs" and
  "preverbs"
<p>
. all objects now call create when first loaded, even if loaded via
  inheritance (create called in the original objects, not what's
  being inherited)
<p>
. crash in master.c is now called with three args (type of crash,
  command_giver, current_object)
<p>
. if the driver crashes it tries to dump its core file in <mudlib dir>/cores
  if that dir exists and core dumping is enabled
<p>
. removed the global define LPCA and replaced it with MUDOS (LPC objects can
  do #ifdef MUDOS)
<p>
. added AUTO_SETEUID option.  if defined, all objects do the equivalent of
  seteuid(getuid(this_object())); when created.
<p>
. added AUTO_TRUST_BACKBONE define so that you could disable the automatic
  trusting of backbone uid objects if you want.
<p>
. added Pinkfish's modifications to parse command package so that it 
  actually works now. :-)
<p>
. added an optional integer argument to the shutdown() efun.  when an
  argument is specified, the driver exits with that exit code.
<p>
. removed smalloc from the driver completely (memory alignment violations and
  other problems made it not worth dealing with).
<p>
. added BSD malloc as an option (seems to work well for those machines having
  slow system mallocs like the HP).
<p>
. added the concepts of "null" and "undefined" to variables and added two
  efuns to make use of these concepts
        * nullp() - returns true for unitiliazed variables and destructed objects
        * undefinedp() - returns true for (1) call_others to non-existant
          methods, (2) access to map keys that aren't in the map, and
          (3) arguments in the formal parameter list of a function for which
          values were not passed.
<p>
. there's a DROP_CORE option in options.h which allows you to specify if you
  want the driver to try to dump core if it has crashed
<p>
. replaced sort_array() with a faster version.  Also changed it so that
  it expects the callback function to return -1, 0, or 1 in a fashion
  similar to how strcmp() does it.
<p>
. added an option to define the default error message users receive.  If it
  is not defined, then all users get wizard level error messages.  This is
  useful since players are the ones that most often experience these errors
  and this lets players report them in a more coherent fashion (maybe?).
<p>
. Reworked the domain stuff (added uid.c and uid.h) by separating the
  concept of uids and euids from that of domains and authors.  The
  wizlist (domain list) code is no longer based on uids but rather on
  domains.  Two new functions are required in master.c:
  string domain_file(string domain); and string author_file(string author);
  In addition, valid_author(string author) should be added to master if
  you wish set_author(string author) to be functional.  Note: domain_file
  and author_file are similar to creator_file (which returns information
  for uids).  domain_file lets the gamedriver know which domain a given
  object should be in an author_file lets the gamedriver know the author
  of the file.
<p>
up to 0.8.1
<p>
. COMPAT_MODE is gone!  You will not be able to run in compatibility mode.
  This means that MudOS cannot be used to run mudlibs designed for the
  2.4.5 LPmud gamedriver.
<p>
. shadow() can be disabled at compile-time.  Check out NO_SHADOWS in
  config.h.  Note that NO_SHADOWS will appear in LPC's preprocessor's
  run-time table if it is defined in config.h.
<p>
. A runtime configuration file replaces much of config.h.  Look at the
  file ./mudlib/config.example.  You must specify a config file as
  an argument to the driver when starting.  It will not run without it.
  The driver will search in CONFIG_FILE_DIR (defined in config.h) for
  the file first and will then search the explicit path.
<p>
. Added Sean Reith's sprintf().  It's huge and therefore a compile-time 
  option defined in config.h.
<p>
. Added RCS as a compile-time option.  This allows wizards access to
  the new efuns ci, co and rlog if those executables exist on your
  system.
<p>
. added dprint flag for .edrc file.  Dprint causes a line to be printed
  following the deletion of some text in ed.
<p>
. Compatibility buster: file permission system is now object-based
  instead of euid-based.
<p>
. save_object() no longer saves 0-valued variables.
<p>
. Virtual objects.  When the GD is asked to compile a file that
  doesn't exist, it just forwards the request to compile the file name
  to the master object.  The return value of compile_object(fname) will
  be an object that will be renamed.
<p>
. set_prompt() from interactive object sets that object's prompt to the
  string argument.
<p>
. If the function write_prompt() exists, it will get called every time
  the driver would normally write a prompt.  (this only gets called when
  not in ed or an input_to)
<p>
. Added privileged object concept.  The master object is by default
  privileged; enable_privileges(ob) from a privileged object makes ob
  privileged; privp(ob) returns whether or not ob is privileged.
<p>
. wizards() returns a string array of all the wizards in the wizlist.
  find_wizard(wizname) returns information about that wizard, in an
  array.  The information returned is: moves, eval cost, errors, heart
  beats, "worth", size of arrays, and number of objects.  This is the
  information since the last reboot.  It is guaranteed to be in this
  order (more fields'll be added later).  If the wizard is not found, 0
  is returned.
<p>
. Crash vector added.  When the game driver receives some signal such
  as segfault, bus error, etc., crash() is called in the master object
  with the string error that was generated.
<p>
. Symbol LPCA is #defined by preprocessor.
<p>
. input_to()'s second argument is now a bitmask number.  0 and 1 work as
  before; 2 doesn't allow shelling out; 3 is like 1 and doesn't allow
  shelling out.  This applies to compatibility mode too, unlike
  receive().  Be sure to use these flags at login time...  localcmd()
  has been removed, check out commands().
<p>
. Only objects with same user id as master object (root uid) or backbone 
  uid, are allowed to add_worth().
<p>
. Gamedriver now keeps track of mappings on status line.  Fixed a memory leak 
  in mapping aggregate initialization.  Mappings now appear in the arrays 
  section of the wizlist.
<p>
. Preprocessor now supports token pasting.  To paste two tokens in a #define, 
  use '##'; e.g. #define SET(str, v) set_##str(v)
<p>
. inherit statement now understands string expressions.
<p>
. You can now clone an object with an environment.
<p>
. Privileged objects can't be destruct()'d by non privileged objects.
<p>
. Snooping of ed mode looks prettier, also improved substitution.
<p>
. New data type added: mapping.  Usage:
      declaration-     mapping m;
      initialization-  m = (["fighting" : 35, "swimming" : 3]);
      access-          if (num_users["netcom"] > 3) ...
      modify-          skills[skill_name] += 20;
<p>
   Mappings are like arrays but you can index off of strings,
      numbers (even negative ones), arrays, objects, and
      mappings.  save_object() and restore_object() seem to
      handle them fine.
<p>
   * works with mappings, as a composition operator.  Likewise '*='.
<p>
   Alist efuns are no longer.  Alists have been obsolesced by mappings.
<p>
. get_dir() now takes second optional flag argument.  Currently, the only
  flag understood is -1.  If this flag is chosen, instead of returning
  an array of strings get_dir() returns an array of arrays which are
  information about the file.  Information is returned in the order:
  filename, filesize, file update time.
  New efun stat() acts just like get_dir(), and will replace it.
<p>
. Swap file name now includes port number, so that it's possible to run
  debug mud off of same mudlib without messing things up.
<p>
. Third argument to add_action() is now a bitmask.  Flags:
      1 - short verb
      2 - xverb
      4 - preverb (new)
      16 - global verb (new)
      Global verbs can only be added from privileged objects.
      Preverbs can only be added from privileged objects or
      the command giver.
<p>
  Parse order:  global preverbs, then local preverbs, then
                local verbs, then global verbs.
<p>
  The "n", "s", "e", "w" hardcoded aliases have been removed
     from the GD, you'll have to use global verbs to do the
     same thing.
<p>
. Added new modifier to sscanf(): '*'.  It allows you to skip over a
  field without having to use a dummy variable.  e.g.
    sscanf(file_name(ob), "%*s#%d", num);
  It's just an efficiency hack; you don't really need this.
<p>
. C++ style comments (//) now work.
<p>
. Restricted ed mode.  If this option was compiled in, if the
  interactive object which called ed isn't a wizard (wizardp() == 0),
  that object is in "restricted ed mode".  This only allows the user to
  write to the file that ed was started up in ('x' is the only save
  command which is allowed).  In addition, help messages etc. are
  tailored to the limited set of commands.
<p>
. Netdeath notification.  Upon going netdead, the object which goes
  netdead has the function "net_dead" called on it.
<p>
. cp is back in the parser as an efun.
<p>
. renamed inherit_list efun to deep_inherit_list (since this efun does
  return ALL of the files inherited by the object in question)
  and made a new efun called inherit_list that only returns a list of
  the files directly inherited by the object in question.  This efun
  will be useful when writing a deep update command.
<p>
. overloaded the definition for the stat() efun so that if it is applied to a
  regular file instead of a directory, it returns information on
  that file.  The information returned is a three element array:
  (file_size, file_modification_time, update_time_of_associated object)
  The times returned will be useful in writing a deep update command.
  This overloaded version of stat requires a full pathname as an argument.
  You can check if stat() fails by seeing if the returned vector has size 0.
  (e.g. if (sizeof(v) == 0) handle_error())
<p>
. Overloaded call_other() so that it can take an array as the first
  argument.  e.g. users()->quit(); (the return value is always 0 now)
<p>
. move_object(ob) is now equivalent to move_object(this_object(), ob).
  This may phase out the latter usage.
<p>
. Every object now has the macro DIR defined, which is the directory 
  that the object's .c file is in.
<p>
. process_input() is called on the player object if it exists for
  every line of input passed to the parser by that player.
  process_input should return a string.  That string is the actual
  string which is parsed by the driver.  This allows you to do things
  like nicknames or aliases quickly and easily.
<p>
. Made in_edit and in_input take an optional argument which is an
  object, so you can check the status of other objects.
<p>
. New efuns:
   userp(ob) returns whether or not ob is a user.
<p>
   new(obname) returns clone_object(obname).  clone_object()
      won't be around for long.
<p>
   remove_action(func, verb) added.
<p>
   master() returns the master object.
<p>
   in_input() returns 1 if current object is in an input_to().
<p>
   in_edit() returns 1 if current object is editing.
<p>
   mapp() returns 1 if argument is a mapping.
<p>
   receive(str) sends interactive message to current object,
      returns 1 if current object is interactive.
<p>
. commands() returns an array of arrays detailing the sentences of the
  current object.  Subarray structure: 0=verb, 1=flags,2=defining
  object.
<p>
. enable_wizard() makes current object into a wizard.  Wizards don't
  add moves on the wizlist, and get better error reporting than "your
  overly sensitive mind...".
<p>
. wizardp() returns whether argument is a wizard or not.
<p>
. ci, co, rlog (if the parser was compiled with RCS turned on).
  ci (string filename, string log_messag, int major, int minor); 
  co (string filenamem, int major, int minor);
  (major and minor are the major and minor version numbers)
  rlog (string filename);
<p>
. get_char().  Works exactly like input_to, except that it responds to
  a single character of input.  Warning: this doesn't work well with
  clients.
<p>
. mud_name() Returns the name of the mud as defined in the config file.
<p>
. allocate_mapping(int) 
  This efun isn't strictly
  required in order to use a mapping, it merely serves to give the gamedriver
  a hint regarding how many elements the mapping may be expected to
  eventually contain.  So long as the mapping contains fewer than the
  specified maximum number of elements, the gamedriver will use
  contiguous memory to store the elements.  Once this number of elements
  is exceeded, the game driver begins malloc'ing the space for the
  elements separately as needed.  Note that using "map = ([])" to
  initialize the map is the same as using "map = allocate_mapping(0)".
<p>
. set_hide(int) allows a privileged object to hide itself from
  find_living(), find_object(), find_player().
<p>
. map_delete(mapping,index) - removes a given pair (index, value) from
  the mapping 'mapping'.
<p>
. keys(mapping) - returns an array of the indices of a mapping.
<p>
. undefinedp(mixed) - returns TRUE if the argument is undefined.  You can
  check for inclusion of a given index in a mapping with undefinedp.  E.g.
  if (undefinedp(x["index"])) write("index isn't in mapping 'x'\n");
  This function also works on values returned from call_other.  Call_other's
  on non-existant functions return values that cause undefinedp to evaluate
  to TRUE.
<p>
. children(object) - returns an array of all the objects which were cloned
  from the argument passed to it.
<p>
. message(string,string,mixed,object *) - general purpose replacement
  This efun is a generic messaging function meant to replace all current
  communication efuns in the future (say, shout, tell_*, printf,
  write, etc).  It communicates directly to catch_tell in the
  targets.
<p>
. Virtual objects
   The immediately obvious thing to use them for is virtual
   territories.  Want to create a desert with 10,000 rooms?  You
   can, now.  You could even make it a 'sparse territory' by making
   it mostly virtual, with some occasional detailed rooms thrown in.
   The recommended strategy is to have the compile_object() code
   in the master object look like:
<p>
    object compile_object(string fname) {
       return (object)
          "/secure/virtual_object"->compile_object(fname);
    }
<p>
   This keeps the complexity of the master object down.  Then
   have the virtual_object server delegate its responsibility.  e.g.
   if an undefined room occurs in a wizard's castle, have it call
   compile_object(fname) in that wizard's castle.c file.  Better do
   a security check as well.
