1)  Send email to mudos-info-request@actlab.rtf.utexas.edu if you wish to be
    added to (or removed from) a MudOS mailing list that will be used to
    send out information on new MudOS versions and example mudlib code that
    demonstrates MudOS features.

2)  Send email to mudos-request@actlab.rtf.utexas.edu if you wish to be added
    to a mailing list for discussing the MudOS driver (proposed features etc).

3)  Send email to mudos-bugs@actlab.rtf.utexas.edu if you find a bug (or bugs)
    in the MudOS driver that is not already listed in the ./doc/driver/bugs
    file.  If you do report a bug be sure to include the following
    informaton:

    MudOS version (e.g. 0.9.15)

    mudlib you are using (also specify the mudlib yours is based upon if you
    didn't start from scratch)

    machine type (NeXT, sun4, RS/6000, etc).  The more specific you can be,
    the better (e.g. a model # might be useful in some circumstances).

    operating system and version (NeXTStep 3.0, SunOS 4.1, etc).  Be sure
    to note any peculiarites that your particular installation may have
    (especially those related to the networking portions of the OS).

    Information specifying how to duplicate the problem.  Be specific.

    Any fixes you may have if you have fixed the problem (patch files
    generated using 'diff -cr old_dir new_dir' would be much appreciated).
    Short of a fix, a pointer to an LPmud-based driver that contains a fix
    would also be appreciated.
