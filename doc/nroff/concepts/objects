* What is an object?

An object consists of a collection of functions (also called 'methods')
and data (variables) on which the functions operate.  The only way to
manipulate the data contained in an object is via one of the functions
defined by the object.

Every single thing in a mud is an object.  Rooms are objects.  Weapons
are objects.  Even your character is an object (a special kind of object
called "interactive" but still an object in most every respect).  Each
object (except possibly virtual objects) in the mud is associated with
some file written in LPC (in the mud's directory structure) that describes
how the object is to interact with the gamedriver and the rest of the objects
in the mud.
