.SH NAME
exec() - switches a player (interactive) connection from one object to another

.SH SYNOPSIS
int exec( object to, object from );

.SH DESCRIPTION
This efunction allows the interactive link to a given object to be
migrated to another object.  That is, after a successful exec(to, from)
call, interactive(to) will return 1 and interactive(from) will return 0.
The player that was controlling 'from' will begin controlling 'to' following
the exec() call.  Note that this is a powerful function and its use must
be restricted if you wish to attempt to have a secure mud.  The proper
way to restrict the use of exec() is to make a simul_efun of the same name
and then use valid_override(4) to restrict the use of a simul_efun override
(i.e. efun::exec()).  The exec() function returns 1 if the switch is
successful (and 0 otherwise).
