.SH NAME
save_object() - save the values of variables in an object into a file

.SH SYNOPSIS
int save_object( string name, int flag );

.SH DESCRIPTION
Save all values of non-static variables in this object in the file `name'.
valid_write() in the master object determines whether this is allowed.
If the optional second argument is 1, then variables that are zero (0) are also
saved (normally, they aren't).  Object variables always save as 0.

.SH RETURN VALUE
save_object() returns 1 for success, 0 for failure.

.SH SEE ALSO
restore_object(3)
