A line of the form:

#include "filename"

will cause the compiler to pretend that the entire contents of 'filename'
are actually contained in the file being compiled.  If you want to include
a certain function in many different objects, use the 'inherit' statement
instead.  #including causes each object to have it's own copy of the
code, while inheriting causes many objects to share code.
