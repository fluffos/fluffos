DEBUGMALLOC_EXTENSIONS not only keeps track of how much is allocated, but
also associates a numeric tag and a string label with each block, allowing
it to check memory for consistency and determine where any given block
was allocated from.

Useful for tracking and removing memory leaks from the driver.
