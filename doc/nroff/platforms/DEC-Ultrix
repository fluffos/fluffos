MudOS hints for DECStation Ultrix:

in the Makefile,
 you'll need to uncomment UALARM_C and UALARM_O
 make sure RESOLV is commented out
 use smalloc for best memory performance

MudOS seems to compile fine with the system's cc.  Use -O2 for maximum
optimization.

I ran into problems when running a gcc-compiled version of the driver on
an Ultrix DECstation (-bobf).
