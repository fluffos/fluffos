MudOS hints for the DEC Alpha running OSF/1:

Don't try to use smalloc, and probably not bsdmalloc either.

Don't define any BINARIES stuff in options.h--it doesn't support 64
bit machines (yet).

I wasn't able to compile the driver with gcc on Alpha; only cc.  And when
using optimization, there were crashes.
