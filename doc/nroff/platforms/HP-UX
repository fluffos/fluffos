MudOS hints for HP-UX:
 
in the Makefile,
 make sure RESOLV is commented out
 uncomment UALARM_C and UALARM_O
 uncomment EXTRALIBS=-lBSD
 use smalloc for best memory/speed performance--system malloc is way slow
 
PA-RISC machines (at least):
 MudOS runs fine compiled with cc under HP-UX 7.x and 8.x.  It does not work
  with 9.0x's cc (might be OK if you turn off optimization?).
 With cc, use OPTIMIZE=+O3 +Obb3000 for maximum optimization.

Use gcc if possible.
