.SH NAME
enable_commands() - allow object to use 'player' commands

.SH SYNOPSIS
Depercated:
  void enable_commands( void );

Since FluffOS 3.0-alpha7.1:
  void enable_commands( int setup_actions = 0 );

.SH DESRIPTION
enable_commands() marks this_object() as a living object, and allows
it to use commands added with add_action() (by using command()).
When enable_commands() is called, the driver also looks for the
local function catch_tell(), and if found, it will call it every time
a message (via say() for example) is given to the object.

Since FluffOS 3.0-alpha7:
This function now accept int, default to 0. which has same meaning of old form.
which merely re-enables commands, but don't setup actions. (it should have been
cleared when previously called disable_commands())

When setup_actions > 0, Driver will re-setup all the actions by calling init() on its environment, sibling and inventory objects. (in that order).

.SH BUGS
Do not call this function in any other place than create() or strange
things will likely occur.
