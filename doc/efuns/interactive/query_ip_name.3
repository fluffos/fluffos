.SH NAME
query_ip_name() - return the ip name of a given player object.

.SH SYNOPSIS
string query_ip_name( object ob );

.SH DESCRIPTION
Return the DNS PTR record for player 'ob's IP .  An asynchronous
DNS reverse lookup is triggered on new connection to the server.

Before lookup finishes, this function returns same result as 'query_ip_number(3)'.

After lookup finishes, if lookup is succesful, this funciton will return
the DNS PTR value for the IP of this object. If lookup failed, (due to
network issues, PTR record not configured for this IP etc), this function
will continue to return same result as 'query_ip_number(3)'.

The result is cached, there is no overhead for this function.

.SH SEE ALSO
query_ip_number(3), query_host_name(3), resolve(3), socket_address(3)
