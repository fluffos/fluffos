.SH NAME
input_to() - causes next line of input to be sent to a specified function

.SH SYNOPSIS
varargs void input_to( string | function fun, int flag, ... );

.SH DESCRIPTION
Enable next line of user input to be sent to the local function `fun' as
an argument. The input line will not be parsed by the driver.
.PP
Note that input_to is non-blocking which means that the object calling
input_to does not pause waiting for input.  Instead the object continues
to execute any statements following the input_to.  The specified function
`fun' will not be called until the user input has been collected.
.PP
If "input_to()" is called more than once in the same execution, only the
first call has any effect.
.PP
If optional argument `flag' is non-zero, the line given by the player will
not be echoed, and is not seen if snooped (this is useful for collecting
passwords).
.PP
The function `fun' will be called with the user input as its first argument
(a string). Any additional arguments supplied to input_to will be passed on to
`fun' as arguments following the user input.
