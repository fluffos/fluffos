BSD malloc is a very fast memory allocator; the down side is that it uses
alot of extra memory to keep track of blocks.  If speed is more important
that memory usage, tho, this might be best.  It also keeps track of
memory usage statistics.

BSD malloc requires the sbrk() system call work on your system.
