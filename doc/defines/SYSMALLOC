SYSMALLOC means use the standard memory allocation routines for your system.
How good it actually is depends on your system.

Since it is the allocator that comes with your operating system, it is the
most reliable one; the down side is that the alternate allocators included
with this package are faster than most system memory allocators.

Also, SYSMALLOC provides no statistics about memory usage.
